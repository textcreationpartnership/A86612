            <title>The pagan preacher silenced. Or, an answer to a treatise of Mr. John Goodwin, entituled, the pagans debt &amp; dowry. Wherein is discovered the weaknesse of his arguments, and that it doth not yet appear by scripture, reason, or the testimony of the best of his own side, that the heathen who never heard of the letter of the Gospel, are either obliged to, or enabled for the believing in Christ; and that they are either engaged to matrimonial debt, or admitted to a matrimonial dowry. Wherein also is historically discovered, and polemically discussed the doctrin of Universal grace, with the original, growth and fall thereof; as it hath been held forth by the most rigid patrons of it. / By Obadiah Howe, A.M. and pastor of Horne-Castle in Lincolnshire.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Edications and Epiſtles plead pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; to commit a Treatiſe to the wide world without theſe <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries,</hi> would be to thruſt it forth ſeemingly naked, and ſo be a <hi>Soloeciſme</hi> both to the preſent, and the practices of Antiquity, becauſe many expect I ſhall ſay ſomething; but becauſe it is the reſult but of ſecond thoughts, I ſhall ſay but little. For me to tell thee much of the perſons engaged herein, would be an unſeemly Digreſſion; and to tell thee of the matter of the enſuing Treatiſe here, would be a too unſeaſonable anticipatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: only of the occaſion thereof a word or two.</p>
            <p>The Moraliſts tel us, that <hi>Virtutes ſunt conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xae;</hi> virtues are linked in an irrefragable chain; and ſo are divine Truths connected and tied together by ſuch rational <hi>ſequitur's,</hi> that they all point at a <hi>concentricity</hi> in that unity of faith ſpoken of by the Apoſtle. And as <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Truths</hi> are linked, ſo are vices and errors; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only with this difference; <hi>Truths</hi> are ſo coupled as the Hangings and Curtains of the
<pb facs="tcp:118748:3"/>
Tabernacle, by the top and the ſides thereof with rings of gold, to the ornament and beauty of the Houſe of God: but Errours are like <hi>Samſons</hi> foxes, tied together onely by the tails, purpoſely to ſet on fire the glorious harveſt of divine Truths.</p>
            <p>It is wel known, that thoſe flames that did utterly conſume the peace of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, have miſerably of late broken out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; and as it was then, that <hi>Arminius,</hi> though he penn'd a ſmall Tract <hi>De componen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Religionis diſsidio,</hi> yet he himſelf was no ſmal Incendiary; even ſo it is now.</p>
            <p>I need not tell thee that the fewel of that fire was the hot agitation of thoſe five Points, which when the Remonſtrants came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves upon, at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> they did not load their <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> with ſuch a voluminous Title, as to rehearſe all and the ſingular Articles; but this, <hi>De Predeſtinatione cum ſuis annexis:</hi> granting us <hi>gratis,</hi> That <hi>No abſolute Election, Univerſal Redemption, Univerſal Grace, Reſiſtibility of Grace, Apoſtacie from Grace</hi> were ſo mutually interwoven, that they muſt either ſtand or fall together. Some indeed, there have been of late of ſuch clouded <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals,</hi> that they have driven on furiouſly in ſome, but have imagined they might relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
<pb facs="tcp:118748:3"/>
other of the <hi>five Points:</hi> ſuch I leave, as not worthy an examen, being men incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of carrying their own interſt, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where it lyeth. But Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> with whom I have now engaged, is ſomething in this more diſcreet; for when he comes forth (like <hi>Saul</hi>) higher by the head then the reſt of his brethren, in that great Body, <hi>Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Redeemed,</hi> hee orders this little Tract to follow him as his Armour-bearer; wherein he doth, (or would at leaſt) prove an <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſufficient Grace,</hi> without which he can never prove an <hi>Univerſall Redemption.</hi> In which, although for the ſubſtance of his work, he doth but follow the ſteps of his Anceſtours; yet for the manner of it, hee appears like <hi>Goliah,</hi> that ſets forth in his might to <hi>defie the whole Hoſt of Iſrael.</hi> None (I am confident) amongſt the Philiſtines, hath been found to engage ſo far, and ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly as he hath done. His pen is his ſpear, and his voluble expreſſions, and daring bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and poliſhed phraſiologies have made it ſwell into the magnitude of a Weavers beam; yet I am confident, ſome little ſtones out of the bag of Scripture and Reaſon, will ſmite him down. This I have (by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine help) in my enſuing Diſcourſe attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb facs="tcp:118748:4"/>
for me to ſay any thing of it here, would be not ſo much to ſatisfie thee, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſe thee. I have an adverſary that will loſe no ground by cowardize; his works are all along full fraught with ſuch aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which have neither the ſtabiliment of Scripture, evidence of Reaſon, patronage of Authority, nor any ſeconds of the beſt of his own ſide; ſo we may preſume of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that he will be left in the combat to mannage his own quarrell. Of thoſe Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodox and impious paſſages of his in all his Works, Catalogues are extant by better hands then mine; yet in this ſmall Tract of his, <hi>The Pagan Debt and Dowry,</hi> there are ſome few that will increaſe the ſtore.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>That by the light of Nature God is known or knowable, &amp;c. that men may by it come to gather <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="3">3. <hi>That the Apoſtle, Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>ſheweth that by that</hi> hearing <hi>whereby faith is wrought, or which is able to produce it, is meant the hearing of the words, ſound of the heavens, the day and the night,</hi> p. 10.</p>

            </p>
            <p>With many others, which it cannot but be as unpleaſing to refel, as to repeat; In all which he doth magnifie Nature, and exceedingly depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate Chriſt, and his perſonal diſcoveries, and ſo brings him to open ſhame; which are all of them called to the teſt, and examined in the following Treatiſe, which I commend to thy candid overſight.

The Sunne diſplayes the glory of Gods power no leſſe every year, in reviving plants, and trees, after a whole <hi>Winters Epilepſie;</hi> whence we conclude beyond contradiction, that God can raiſe our <hi>bodies</hi> out of the <hi>boſome</hi> of the Earth, with more facility then the Sunne re-quickens any <hi>vegetables</hi> upon the <hi>face</hi> of it. The Sunne as openly Preacheth the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God in its occulter operations upon <hi>Minerals,</hi> which it ſo curiouſly <hi>works,</hi> where we would not think it did <hi>look,</hi> and doth a kind of <hi>ſtupendious miracles</hi> by <hi>inviſible influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Shortly, the Sunne tells all the world ſo plainly, that there is <hi>God Omnipotent,</hi> that too many <hi>Pagans</hi> have taken the Sunne for that <hi>God.</hi> So children are apt to look on a <hi>King at Arms,</hi> as <hi>King of the Realm.</hi> The Sunne Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that God in its <hi>face,</hi> which too too many men eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where deny in their <hi>heart;</hi> but of Chriſt the Lord, it had never a word to ſay, unleſſe perhaps once, when it muffled its face, as bluſhing at the monſtrous indignities offered by <hi>poor worms on Earth</hi> to the great <hi>Prince of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> But even <hi>then</hi> the Sunne ſpake ſo low under its <hi>mask,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves did not <hi>hear,</hi> much leſſe did the <hi>Heathens underſtand</hi> it.

            </p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118748:10"/>
concerning the <hi>impoſſibility of new immanent acts in God,</hi> Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> profeſſeth to oppoſe my Doctrine, not <hi>as untrue, but uncertain, Section</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 16.

            <p>Beſides, Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> himſelf profeſſeth the ſame, if I underſtand him, (<hi>Red.

And in that reſpect, I will God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for his ſatisfaction, without breach of the Agreement between Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> and me, handle that point in <hi>Latine</hi> (which is the only fit Language for ſuch a Diſcourſe) long before Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſhall hang up the leaſt member of the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> at the doors of his <hi>Meeting houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>latter,</hi> I had no more to doe then to ſhew, that <hi>the Doctrine of Juſtification from Eternity is not ſo horrible a blaſphemy as M.</hi> Goodwin <hi>was pleaſed to brand it for.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he may know, that I look upon that of <hi>Condemnation from Eternity</hi> (maintained by no man that I wot of, though jumbled in by him) to be no leſſe; and therefore I ſingled out that of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and let paſſe the other, ſaying, that <hi>in Gods Decree from Eternity to juſtifie and condemn men in time, there was ſomewhat like Juſtification</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Condemnation,</hi> which is of another conſideration. Nor can I be perſwaded there is any abſurdity in ſaying, that <hi>in Gods Decree from Eternity to juſtifie and condemn men in time, there is ſomewhat that looks like Juſtification,</hi> though there be nothing <hi>that looks like Juſtification in the Decree which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Condemnation;</hi> more then in ſaying, that <hi>my purpoſe to goe to</hi> Oxford <hi>and return to</hi> London, <hi>carries ſomewhat that

reſpects my going to</hi> Oxford, though my <hi>purpoſe to go to</hi> Oxford carries nothing in it that concerns <hi>my return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Maſter <hi>Baxter,</hi> if in any particular I have miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented him, (which is the main thing he laies to my charge) I ſhall, as I diſcover it, willingly retract it; and it is not unlikely but we do both underſtand each other much better then we did. But I deſire Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> to know, that Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> profeſſed he was offended with me for nothing ſo much, as joining him with <hi>John Goodwin.</hi> And howbeit he pleaſe to let fall a word of my <hi>inclemency to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> Goodwin, in one paſſage twice quoted by him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly remembred by Maſter <hi>Goodwin,</hi> I believe Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> deſires his Reader ſhould take notice of that place for the many good words I beſtow on him there, (as ſome others have conceived) farre beyond the proportion of his deſerts. In Concluſion, ſo far am I from being convinced of offending by my <hi>frolicks,</hi> that I am reſolved to bee as <hi>pleaſant</hi> as ever in my Language, let who will chuſe to be <hi>bitter;</hi> only I ſhall ſtill pray to God to forgive us all <hi>our iniquities of our holieſt things,</hi> and to work our hearts to a Chriſtian endeavour of <hi>overcoming evil with good,</hi> and to the affecting of no greater Conqueſt then the <hi>captivating of all our thoughts to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I firſt caſt mine eyes upon this Treatiſe, and the Title of it, which preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us with the <hi>Pagans</hi> debt and dowry. I wondred that the match ſhould be ſo ſoone ſtruck up betwixt Chriſt and his <hi>Pagan</hi> Spouſe; eſpecially conſidering, that he had entailed his conjugal affection to his Church which he loveth, and preſenteth as his only glorious Bride unto his Father. And I ſhould ſtil have continued wondering, but that I found under it the Name of Mr. <hi>John Goodwin,</hi> whom I perceive to be a man wel underlayed with a ſtock of boldneſſe, urged on with the ſtreſs of Judgement, led on by the hand of leiſure proportionable to ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts as theſe; <hi>(viz.)</hi> to eſtate dowries upon aliens, entitle to the moſt intimate mercies of Chriſt, thoſe whom the Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaketh to be without him, to faſten ſaving grace upon, and to reduce them, <hi>in ſeriem ſalvandorum,</hi> whom the Scripture ſaith,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.12.</note> 
               <hi>are without hope;</hi> And upon this account, I could wel have paſſed by it: But the moment of the queſtion being ſuch, and ſo neerly concerned in that Controverſie, in which I have already publikely engaged, I was provoked to a more narrow and ſerious examination of thoſe things which he no leſſe confidently, then ſingularly thruſts upon his over credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous reader.</p>
            <p>In the purſuance of which, the occaſion and matter of this Treatiſe, are chiefly enquirable.</p>
            <p>I need not inſiſt upon the manner of his writings, which in this as in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118748:12"/>
all others, is with ſo much groundleſſe confidence, tart ſcurrility, ſmooth expreſſions, yet ſwelling words, which may make us collect, that doctrines of divels never want Angels voices, which ſerve as garniſhed ſepulchres, to cover rotten bones, and as ſo much grain to allure the ſimple bird into the ſnare; but the Lord wil diſcover the Prophet who is the ſnare of the fowler in all his wayes.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of this Treatiſe, as many others of the like nature, I find ſuggeſted by himſelf to be in the purſuance of that now much ventilated Article of <hi>Univerſal Redemption.</hi> For in his 60 <hi>pag.</hi> I find this Enthymem,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All men without exception are bound to beleeve in Chriſt.</hi> Ergo, <hi>Chriſt died for all without exception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Argument, the Major is to be ſupplyed to complete a ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm, thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If all men be bound to beleeve in Chriſt, then Chriſt dyed for all. But all men are bound to believe in Chriſt:</hi> Ergo, <hi>Chriſt dyed for all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Argument he would have the world believe to be his own, when not only in this ſhort Treatiſe, but in that Chaos, <hi>Redemption Redeemed,</hi> a large Treatiſe of his, if every bird ſhould take his own feather, he would be left like <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Crow; the Argument is both formed and confirmed to his hand by <hi>Corvin. in Molin.</hi> in the <hi>Acta Synodal.</hi> in the conference at the <hi>Hague;</hi> yet he may know, they never intended to take ſo high a flight,<note place="margin">Chap. 29. §. 14.16. pag. 337 p. 133.

and is not hence concluſive, that they beſpeak none other bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, then thoſe to whom he gives a command to believe, or elſe cals to the ſalvation purchaſed, which is all one with having the letter of the Goſpel: and further they reſt ſatisfied with that rule <hi>[Lex non lata nec intellecta, cum intelligi non poteſt, non obligat,]</hi> a law not given nor underſtood, when it can not be underſtood, bindeth not; yet <hi>I</hi> think they have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on the main <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of univerſal Redemption, with as tender an eye to its neereſt intereſt, as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> can doe.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is evident that all the diſcourſes about univerſal grace are but a meere Countermine to that Argument which is formed by us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Univerſal Redemption: thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If Chriſt died for all, then he would certainly make ſuch diſcoveries of this purchaſe to all, that they may have this ſalvation purchaſed, applyed, and that without exception. But be doth not the latter, therefore not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here are all theſe intricate and winding diſputes about univerſal Grace hatched. Therefore the ſubject of this Treatiſe of Mr. <hi>Goodwins,</hi> is to prove that all the heathens have ſuch diſcoveries of Jeſus by the light of nature, without the letter of the Goſpel, as that they are bound to believe in Chriſt, and have means ſufficient thereunto. And indeed, ſo naturally conſequential is it, (according to our Argument) that if ſuch a purchaſe was ſo univerſally made, it would be as univerſally diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, without which there is no ordinary way of having that purchaſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance applyed; this Argument of ours is founded upon ſuch equitable principles, that the aſſertors of Univerſal Redemption, have all of them, ſome more lightly, others more ſollicitouſly beaten out an univerſal grace, ſufficient, and ſaving, afforded to all men without exception. And that ſuch diſcoveries however made, if wel improved, would bring a ſtock of more grace til they come to be ſaved. And this is the ſubject of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> whole treatiſe, and he ſweats much in the ventilating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which demonſtratively cleareth the evidence of our Conſequence or major propoſition, which runneth thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If Jeſus Chriſt died for every man without exception, then he makes to every man without exception ſuch diſcoveries of himſelf, that all men by them might come to believe in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when they come to the aſſumptive part, and to make out this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal call, and general tender of grace; to cleere that ſuch diſcoveries are made to all men without exception, no men more divided in their ſentences, loſt in their own uncertainties (every man contradicting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and one another, then theſe men) as ſhall appear in theſe following inſtances.</p>
            <p>Firſt how uncertain and wavering are they in the formation of their aſſertion, how unſatisfied are they about the terms of it, to make it to appear to be univerſal?</p>
            <p>The Remonſtrants in their Synodical writings, give the Argument thus,
<q>Whoever are bound to believe in Chriſt, for them Chriſt died.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But all and every man as wel the Elect as Reprobate, are bound to

               </note> 
               <hi>Ergo, he dyed for all and every man.</hi> Wherein the <hi>All</hi> contended for who are bound to believe, is only <hi>Elect and Reprobate;</hi> but theſe two notions do not take in or involve all and every perſon without exception, and this appears thus: Thoſe that are Elect, are conſidered as believers; and thoſe that are Reprobated, are conſidered as unbelievers; but there are many that are neither believers, nor yet unbelievers, as <hi>Surdi, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, Infantes, Indi,</hi> deaf, madmen, infants, Indians; being ſuch as to whom God neither doth diſpenſe, nor is ready to diſpenſe his Divine grace; they come not under either of thoſe notions.

               </note> But the Collocutors at <hi>Hague,</hi> propound it with an other face. <hi>Thoſe whom God commands to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, for them Chriſt dyed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Collat. Hag. <hi>p. 133.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>but God commands not only the Elect, but other men to believe in Chriſt,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Chriſt died not for the Elect, but for other men alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is a farre different concluſion from the former. For the firſt way expreſſed both Elect and Reprobate,<note place="margin">Corvin. in Mol. <hi>cap. 29. §. 14. 16.</hi>
               </note> but this doth not; for if upon their owne principles, ſome, yea many, as deaſe, mad men, Indians, be neither believers nor unbelievers, and ſo neither Elect no Reprobate; then theſe two phraſes <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>Other men,</hi> do not involve reprobates, and ſo he may die for Elect and <hi>Other men,</hi> yet not for all.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Corvinus</hi> preſents us with it in an other different forme, thus; <hi>Whom God commands to believe in Chriſt, for them Chriſt is dead; But God commands all men to believe in Chriſt, and all are bound thereto,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Chriſt died for all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if they cannot more diſtinctly determine then thus, about the expreſſion of the perſons on whom this univerſaltie and obligation to believe is laid; we have reaſon little enough to expect more poſitive and ſetled judgments in the reſt. The firſt urgeth, that <hi>Elect and Reprobate,</hi> the ſecond that <hi>Elect and other men,</hi> the third ſaith that <hi>All men</hi> are bound to believe: and where ſhould we fix our thoughts to oppoſe, if they be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved to aſſert? But to let this paſſe, and to examine whether they be leſſe uncertain in the next thing conſiderable, <hi>Arminius,</hi> when he undertaketh, <hi>Mr. Perkins,</hi> ſaith thus, <note n="a" place="margin">Omnes homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes aliqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione vocantur, <hi>Arm.

But to let this paſſe, and all of the like nature, I ſhal examine how conſiſtent he is with himſelf.</p>
            <p>In the frontiſpiece of his treatiſe, he promiſeth to prove that thoſe that never heard of the letter of the Goſpel, are yet bound to believe in Jeſus Chriſt; but how many words doth he produce, until he proceede to the 29 page of his Book, that tended to that purpoſe? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved is Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> what to prove or what to aſſert?</p>
            <p>Doth not Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in the firſt part of his Treatiſe, contend for an immediate ſufficiency in the Heathen to believe in Chriſt, and to draw out the moſt intimate concluſions of the Goſpel, and that by the light of nature, by the works of providence, and by raine, and fruitful ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that there is ſuch a light darted from theſe that men have a ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of believing? But here Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> wavereth; Sometimes it is to-believe in Chriſt, as in the frontiſpiece of his book, wherein he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to prove, that men that never heard of the letter of the Goſpel, are yet bound to believe in Chriſt, as alſo pag. 9.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it is to believe only this, as he ſaith, pag. 10. <hi>That there hath been ſome mediation or ſome attonement or other made and accepted by God for the ſins of men.</hi> And this is much different from the former; for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118748:15"/>
though God uſeth this way of attonement by Chriſt, yet he was not tyed by any natural neceſſity to it; ſo that though the light of nature might diſcover an attonement yet it wil not hence follow, that by it men may believe on a Chriſt, that is, an attonement made by that perſon, and that way.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it is neither of theſe, but a third, farre different from both,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 13</note> as he ſaith, <hi>They have means of believing;</hi> I mean, <hi>of believing,</hi> 1. <hi>That God is.</hi> 2. <hi>That he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him</hi> All which doth no where lead to, or diſcover a Chriſt, as I ſhal afterwards clearly ſhow.</p>
            <p>But doth he not again, as not daring to truſt all in this veſſel, relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh his immediate ſufficiency, and pleads for a mediate ſufficiencie in <hi>pag.</hi> 15. to this effect? Not that they can by the light of nature diſcover a Chriſt,<note place="margin">pag. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.

            </p>
            <p>Againe, doth he not ſeat his controverſie (not in any ſufficiency either immediate or mediate, as he pretendeth, but) <hi>pag.</hi> 23. in a remote capacity, which is far different from the former two; and in this ſenſe that they are capable of it, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Goſpel) as any Nation is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Commodities that are exportable out of another Nation, by equitable adreſſes to it. Yea ſometimes thus, that the Goſpel is preacht to all the world (juſt the aſſertion of his brethren, and in him we may ſee their fluctuations) In <hi>pag.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26. he earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that the Goſpel is actually preacht to the world: But in <hi>pag.</hi> 34. he contendeth not for an <hi>Actual,</hi> but a <hi>Virtual and conſtructive</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in this ſenſe; <hi>The Goſpel is preached in ſome eminent places of the world, and its interpreted and conſtructively preached all the world over.</hi> For upon Rom. 10.18, he ſaith, <hi>How can this aſſertion ſtand, but in the ſtrength of this ſuppoſition, that the Apoſtles publiſhing of it in the places where they had opportunity to come, was virtually and conſtructively a preaching through the world.</hi> But leſt this ſhould fail, he is content with a potential preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at laſt, that it <hi>may</hi> be preached. And this he doth <hi>pag.</hi> 23. in this ſenſe, <hi>It is preacht in ſome place of the world, and the reſt of the world may addreſſe themſelves to that place, and ſo come to hear of it,</hi> As the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> came from the South to heare the wiſdome of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And are not theſe fit men to be encountred with reaſon, whoſe reaſon is not yet ſo much reſolved, as to give a ſetled ground of diſpute? It is the deſire of my heart, and my taske, to grapple with the firſt borne of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> ſtrength. But I have this diſadvantage that <hi>Reuben</hi> like, it is as unſtable as water, I have not hitherto annexed any anſwer to Mr.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118748:15"/>
               <hi>Goodwins</hi> or the remonſtrants, becauſe my task hath been hiſtoricall, not diſputative; to ſhow the riſe and progreſſe of this doctrine of univerſal ſaving grace: and hitherto it appears to have had its riſe out of a miſt, not the cleare Sun-light; a miſt of uncertainties and conjectures, not out of the Sun-light of a ſetled and well grounded truth. And as to Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> I ſay, <hi>(Quorſum hae erroris latebra?)</hi> what means theſe ſtarting holes which truth never ſeeketh? which are demonſtrative, not of a deſire to vindicate the truth, but an unwillingneſſe to relinquiſh an errour; theſe are but the doubles and the retropaſſes of the ſubtle fox to foile the ſent, meerely to retard the purſuer. And as their labouring to prove an univerſal grace is demonſtrative of the validity of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſo their dark and unreſolved progreſſe in proving of it, gives much credit and ſtrength to the aſſumption of our argument, and lets me ſee that their invented method for ſuch an univerſal grace is not able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the light, or to give ſatisfaction to any rational ſcrutiny.</p>
            <p>And I am now come to examine Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> aſſertion and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, all along his whole treatiſe.</p>
            <p>That which he aſſerteth is; that every heathen man to whom the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Goſpel never came, is yet bound to believe in Chriſt, and that upon this ground: becauſe they have ſufficient meanes by the creatures, and light of nature, to diſcover Chriſt and the ſumme of the Goſpel, as he ſaith, almoſt as often as he hath pages: an attempt that none of his predeceſſors durſt ever ſo roundly and profeſſedly make.</p>
            <p>In the Examen of which, I muſt propound a few things by way of ſtating &amp; right underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the queſtion in difference betwixt us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when he ſaith, thoſe that never hear of the letter of the Goſpel, are yet bound to beleive in Jeſus Chriſt; I ſuppoſe by the letter of the Goſpel he underſtandeth the commands as well as the promiſes of the Goſpel, the one is Goſpel as well as the other. Hence wee find in the Scripture, obedience to the Goſpel, as well as faith of the Goſpel:<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.8</note> and indeed the commands of the Goſpel are good newes as well as any other part thereof, they being evidences to us that God will again take us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſervice, and give us further work to doe, when wee deſerve to be baniſhed from his face for ever. Then the queſtion will ariſe to this, whether thoſe that never heard the letter of the Goſpel, <hi>(viz.)</hi> neither the commands, nor promiſes, nor any other part of that which wee cal the Goſpel, are yet bound to believe in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he muſt not think that we confine the diſcovery of Chriſt and ſalvation by him to the oral preaching of men, or that the queſtion betwixt us turneth upon this hinge. I leave to the Almighty his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to uſe what meanes he pleaſeth to diſcover his holy will to men, I will thus far comply with Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> that whether men come to know God in Chriſt by reading any part of the written word, or by hearing of it preached, or by immediate revelation of the ſpirit of God, or by an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, as to the ſhepherds, or by a voyce from heaven, as to <hi>Paul,</hi> theſe wayes may all lay an obligation upon us to believe; but then in all theſe they enjoy the letter of the Goſpel. The matter betwixt us in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118748:16"/>
controverſie is, whether thoſe heathen who have onely the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the creature, and the works of common providence to direct them, have ſuch diſcoveries of Chriſt as that they become bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him. This is the purport of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> whole treatiſe, as I ſhal cleare in ſome few inſtances.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 10.</note> In one place he ſaith thus, <hi>[The Scripture intimateth that all men by the light of nature, by ſuch a rational diſcourſe can draw out this Evangelical concluſion, that an attonement is made.]</hi> And in another place thus, <hi>[That hearing by which faith comes, or which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to produce it, is the hearing of the found, and thoſe words which the heavens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>and the day, and night ſpeake. And the conſtant courſe of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſpeaks in the ears of all nations the words of eternal life, as well as thoſe words of Chriſt himſelfe when he was upon earth.]</hi> And in another page thus, <hi>[The heathen who onely have the benefit of the light of nature, together with thoſe impreſſions of good and evil which accompany it, are and have been in ſuch a capacity of having the Goſpel.]</hi> Wherein it plainely appeareth that whatever be the praedicate, yet the ſubject about which all his whole diſcourſe proceeds is, A man having only the light of nature: and it needs muſt be ſo, becauſe otherwiſe what he ſaith will not reach every man without exception: ſo that now the controverſie appears thus: Whether thoſe ſtand bound to believe on Jeſus Chriſt who have no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovery of Jeſus Chriſt, then the light of nature, works of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the book of the creatures, fruitful ſeaſons afford unto them? or whether theſe do make ſuch a diſcovery of Chriſt to all men, as that by it they are and ſtand bound to believe in Chriſt? Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> affirmes in both, I deny in both. I therfore addreſs my ſelf to examine his proofs.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes he was provoked to this treatiſe by a diſcourſe written to him by a Gentleman of worth and learning, ſo that ſeveral pages are ſpent in complements and anti-complements, in which for me to trace him would be both irkſome and uſeleſs. That which firſt occurreth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee taken notice of in reference to the queſtion, wee find in the ſeventh and eighth pages of his treatiſe, where in the cloſe I find theſe words,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 8.</note> 
               <q>[When God commandeth men to repent, certainely he doth in the ſame command them to believe, in as much as that repentance which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is Evangelical.]</q> Which words ſeeme to carry in them the force of an Argument. But herein, as all along, I am put to a double task, both to form his Arguments and anſwer them: but I am not unwilling to do it, the argument therfore if ſyllogiſtically propounded, muſt run thus,
<q>
                  <l>If God command all men to repent, hee commands all to believe in Chriſt.</l>
                  <l>But he commandeth all men to repent, <hi>Acts 17.30.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>
                     </label> Ergo, He commands all men to believe.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The propoſition is grounded upon this, that no Evangelical repentance can be without faith in Chriſt, as he contends. pag. 7.</p>
            <p>The aſſumption is proved by <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. And thus is he ſafely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of the firſt-borne of his ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Before I anſwer diſtinctly to this uncouth and impertinent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I muſt premiſe a few things, that I may be rightly underſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Pagans repentance. There is in every rational creature origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118748:16"/>
imprinted the love of his maker, and thereupon the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture obligeth to love God, which love will ſhew it ſelfe in obedience to his commands, and in caſe of a fall into ſin, this love calls for ſorrow for that delinquency, and a diſplicancy with our ſelves that we ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our Creator, and incur his wrath; and this I deny not to bee a part of the eternal law of God and nature, lying on all men, both li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on earth, and lying in torments, yea, upon the divels in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate condition, ſeeing that it is a duty required of every offending creature as ſuch, and if any ſhall call this repentance, I will grant that there is an obligation lyes upon all Pagans by the light of nature to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; but this is not Evangelical in order to life and ſalvation, which the Goſpel ſo frequently calleth for, and in that cited text, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>M. Goodwin,</hi> of which ſaving repentance and Evangelical, Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> directly and all along ſpeaketh: and this is that repentance which I treat of, otherwiſe I ſhould not be pertinent to Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> aſſertions: and I deſire to be underſtood as ſpeaking of this Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal repentance in order to life and ſalvation. And in this ſenſe I deny that Pagans are obliged to repent by the light of nature, and Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi> quoted text proves it not, for that text includeth not Pagans, but thoſe to whom the Goſpel cometh, as I afterwards ſhew, neither doth it ſpeak of the light of nature, onely an Evangelical command: and if Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> would but learne to conclude with the queſtion, and make his concluſion thus, as it ſhould, <hi>[therefore all Pagans are bound to believe by the light of nature,]</hi> or make his minor to run thus, [But God commandeth all men to repent by the light of nature] his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would not be a birth but a miſcarriage: and though orthodox and good, yet impertinent and uſeleſſe in his buſineſſe. For to anſwer more diſtinctly, I ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> Firſt, What is all this if granted to him? is yet Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to ſeek in the rudiments of diſpute, one of which is to conclude with the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? which is not, whether all men be commanded to believe. But whether thoſe that never heard of the letter of the goſpel be bound to believe? The very concluſion of his Argument expreſſing a command to repent and believe, ſuppoſeth the enjoyment of the letter of the goſpel except he will ſay that the commands of the Goſpel, are not the letter of he Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to the aſſumption I anſwer, it is deniable in that ſenſe, which he muſt receive, if it doe him any good. That is, that God commands all &amp; every man without exception, yea, thoſe that have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the light of nature and not the letter of the Goſpel diſpenſed at all, further then by the creatures; but this is falſe, and that text, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. ſpeaketh not any thing to this purpoſe. And therefore Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> might with credit enough have ſuffered his Antagoniſt in that Adage, <hi>Quid hoc ad Iphicli loves?</hi> w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> out that ſcurrilous retortion of <hi>Balaams aſſe</hi> in exchange; but conſider how hard a thing it is for one of Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi> ſpirit not to be at once both tart and impertinent: but in this it gives us a taſte of what we are to expect in the remains of his works.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:118748:17"/>3. To his Propoſition, I have nothing upon mine owne intereſt, but their principles beget a ſcruple not eaſily ſatisfied, and wee may doubt the concluſive validity of it, it becometh not thoſe of his way to explode a repentance which is without faith in Jeſus Chriſt; and this I prove many wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1 There is nothing more frequent with men of his way then this, to aſcribe to man certaine preparatives to faith and regeneration, which will be found to come little ſhort of repentance; or however, can no more be granted as truth, then repentance it ſelfe. <hi>Corvinus</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>thoſe that are preſt under the burthen of ſin, and are weary, and thirſt after Chriſt, and the ſaving grace by him, are diſpoſed to thoſe benefits that the Lord conferreth on us by the Goſpel.</hi> And hee being urged by his Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt that the deſires of ſalvation, the groanes of a breathing conſcience under the weight of ſin, are parts of regeneration, hee thus reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <note n="a" place="margin">Hoc eſt <gap reason="foreign">

Thus have I taken a ſurvey of this firſt piece of his reaſon, and I am ſorry that a man of ſuch profeſſes and credit in the world, ſhould aſſault us with ſuch an argument at the firſt daſh, whoſe propoſition cannot ſtand with his owne principles, whoſe aſſumption is inconſiſtent with truth, whoſe concluſion is nothing to the queſtion, and therefore I leave M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to ſatisfie himſelfe, whether repentance be a work of the law, or of the Goſpel, or of a third covenant. I am not at all intereſted into theſe intergatories, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. it is ſufficient for me that it is not a work of the law of nature, &amp; to prove it, I accept Mr, <hi>Goodwins</hi> owne grant, which is this, <hi>It cannot be the work of the law, for the law knoweth no repentance, the tenour of the law is more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict and inexorable,</hi> Gal. 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not.</hi> Very Orthodox and right; but how this ſerves his turn, will appeare when he gives ſatisfaction to us in this demand. If the poſitive law of God doe not know or admit of ſuch a thing as repentance,<note n="e" place="margin">Omnium homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num cordibus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculpſit Deus ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ſui cogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem, &amp; aliquam legem ad obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endam perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones, poenarum metum et prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miorum ſpem. <hi>art. Synod.</hi> art. 20, p. 327</note> how can the law of nature bind us to repentance, there being no ſubſtantiall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the law of nature and the lawes of God, ſave onely in the manner of diſcovery. The poſitive law is a law outwardly given and commanded, the law of nature is the ſame law inwardly written and imprinted in the heart. Now if the one be enexorable and admits not repentance, why ſhould the other diſcover and command it? Suppoſe we admit the <hi>placita</hi> of the Remonſtrants in their latitude, thus, <hi>God hath inſcribed in the hearts of men ſome knowledge of himſelfe and a certain law, and perſwaſions to obedience, and hope of reward, and feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> All which they produce as the product of the light and law of nature, yet all theſe ariſe not ſo high as to command repentance; for the poſitive law of God to <hi>Adam</hi> in integrity propounded all theſe, and all theſe might agree with <hi>Adam</hi> then in his beſt condition; but then there was no obligation lay upon him to repent, nor after, till he received the promiſe as <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> himſelfe in ſo many words profeſſeth in his Poſtſcript: which here (before we paſſe from this argument) falleth under examination, and I find ſomething in it that will make this caſe more cleare. It ſeemes that the Gentleman who wrote to <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> had affirmed, that <hi>Adam</hi> during the interval, betwixt his fall and the promiſe, was under an obligation to repent; but who ever it was, I hope
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118748:18"/>
he will not take it ill, if I leave it for him to prove. I am ſo farre confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate with <hi>Mr. Goodwin,</hi> as to think it a miſtake. And here comes in <hi>Mr. Goodwins</hi> poſtſcript, wherein he earneſtly contendeth by ſtreſſe of Argument, that during that time he was under no obligation either of the natural law or poſitive: I might well paſſe all this by as not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any thing at all to my ſelfe, yet I ſhall improve what hee here affirmeth to my owne advantage in clearing the truth; That hee was not bound by the law of nature, he proves thus: <hi>If by the law of nature, then was it required in order to his ſalvation, then there was a principle veſted by God in the nature of man to recover and ſave himſelfe, and this principle to be carryed over unmaymed from the eſtate of integrity to the eſtate of ſin, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he plunged himſelfe, and then alſo to remaine in the ſame vigour in his poſterity, &amp; ſo every perſon of mankind to be in a capacity of ſalvation; &amp; if ſo, then Chriſt muſt have dyed for all without exception.</hi> His intentions in theſe reaſonings I cannot well divine, but what ever it be, I retort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him thus; if they be to overthrow the poſition of his adverſary, as by ſo many monſtruous abſurdities, he muſt know they are all his own; if otherwiſe he intend hereby to gaine upon his adverſary in theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, and draw him by degrees into his owne tent by the ducture of theſe his owne poſitions, then I thus argue, Either all theſe are the genuine and legitimate inferences from his poſitions, or not: if not, then he beateth the ayre, and muſt caſt about for another poſtſcript; if they be, then I demand an account why Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ownes the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and yet diſclaimes the Poſition from whence they genuinely flow; when any one may eaſily ſee it to be more congruous to the whole purport of his treatiſe to affirm it, then to deny it. Seeing it is his task to prove that every man by the law of nature onely is bound to believe &amp; repent, which is utterly out irrecoverably loſt, if <hi>Adam</hi> in that interval was not bound to believe or repent, in which he had the light of nature as much as ever after. I might here propound an Argument of ſome conſiderable ſtrength againſt his main poſition, thus, If <hi>Adam</hi> was not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the law of nature to repent, then his poſterity is not. But hee was not, <hi>Ergo,</hi> his poſterity is not: But I ſhall purſue this more pertinently when I anſwer his argument, whereby he proves that the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bindeth every man to repent and believe.</p>
            <p>Thus having propounded his firſt Argument, in which he hath done nothing in relation to the controverſie in hand, becauſe he hath not in it proved, that God ever gave a command, or laid an obligation upon any ſuch man or men to repent, to whom the letter of the Goſpel never came, either in the commands or the promiſes of it. He yet can (before he begin handſomely to combat) triumph as he doth,<note place="margin">

               <hi>pag.</hi> 8. 9. where he concludeth thus: <hi>From the premiſes it further appeareth, that the Gentiles to whom the letter, the written letter of the Goſpel never came, and amongſt whom the name of Jeſus Chriſt (haply) was never named, yet in ſufficient propriety of ſpeech, and largeneſſe enough of truth, may be ſayd to have the Goſpel preached to them, though not in that critical formality of the ſignification of the word (<gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:118748:18"/>I wonder <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> doth not bluſh that the world ſhould ſee ſo much weakneſſe, falſhood and boldneſſe come from him in one line.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What cauſe hath he to ſay, that this he hath now uttered, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeares from the premiſes? was there ever mention made of the Gentiles who never heard of the letter of the Goſpel, or of the name of Chriſt, or of the preaching of the Goſpel to ſuch? Let him, if he think good, form thoſe premiſes and this concluſion into an Argument, and I believe it will be of ſmal ſtrength.</p>

               </gap> it is ſome ſuch thing as that not onely, not by the premiſes, but not by all that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> can ſay, will yet appear. It is this, <hi>that they that never had the letter, the written letter of the Goſpel, or the name of Chriſt named, may yet properly be ſaid to have had the Goſpel preached.</hi> But,</p>

(the letter, the written letter) ſurely he doth intend to play with this terme (letter of the Goſpel) as if we held that none are tyed to believe but they to whom the written letter comes, or as if it were his task to prove that; more are tyed to believe then they to whom the written letter is come. I ſay again, it matters not how the diſcovery be made, by reading, hearing a voice from heaven, an Angel from heaven, or any, which way God ſhall chuſe, ſo that it be but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what nature diſcovereth, it confirmeth us, and overthroweth him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How miſerably doth he praevaricate and change the face of the queſtion? that which he is to prove, is, that they are bound to believe, to whom the letter of the Goſpel never cometh: but he now deceitfully ſhaffles in an Heterogenius expreſſion, if he himſelfe divine right, <hi>viz. [Or the Name of Chriſt ever named:]</hi> Betwixt which and the former there is a wide difference; ſo much, as that the one may be without the other, as he ſaith, pag. 9. <hi>The Goſpel was preached to the ancient Jews, yet the name of Chriſt was not named amongſt them.</hi> Hereby he hath this advantage, that we ſhould think it his task to prove, that they that have not the name of Chriſt named, are bound to believe; when his aſſertion looks quite with another face: this is nothing inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118748:20"/>
goſpel, are onely ſaid properly to have the goſpel preached? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, in oppoſition to Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> that the antient Jewes in having the goſpel preached, they had Chriſt by name preached unto them. And the more am I provoked to a word or two in this particular, becauſe it will be uſeful to us in the point of faith in Jeſus, under the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Now I ſay, they had the name of Chriſt in the due latitude and acceptation of the word <hi>(Name.)</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> I hope, ſeeth a wide difference betwixt preaching the name <hi>(Chriſt)</hi> and preaching Chriſt <hi>(by name:)</hi> as it is in one thing to preach or ſpeak the name <hi>(God)</hi> and another thing to preach God by name, for hee hath many names.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I premiſe this alſo, the queſtion betwixt us will not be whether they were well acquainted with the diſcoveries of Chriſt by his names; probably they might not, and yet it be true that he was preached by name. As it was true that God was preached to the Jews by name when he bad <hi>Moſes</hi> ſay, <hi>(I am hath ſent thee,)</hi> although they did not ſo well know him by that name: which being premiſed, I thus proceed. As that is a mans name wherby he is knowne and diſtinguiſhed: (<hi>nomen quaſi no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcimen,</hi> or <hi>notamen</hi>) ſo is Gods name, not only the words <hi>(God) (Lord,)</hi> but the tearms, <hi>(Almighty) (Jehovah) (I am)</hi> are Gods names. So of Chriſt, we muſt not confine the name of Chriſt to the words <hi>(Chriſt)</hi> or <hi>(Jeſus,)</hi> but <hi>Counſellour, Everlaſting Father, Prince of Peace, Wonderful,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 9.6, 7 Zech. 6.12 Iſai. 11.1</note>

            <p>But had Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> carryed it at this turne, ſo as to prove that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Jewes had neither the letter of the goſpel, nor the name of Chriſt preached, and yet could produce ſuch a peremptory evidence upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord againſt us, from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. that the goſpel was preached to them, what a plauſible way had he found out to make good that in the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of language, thoſe heathen might have the Goſpel preached ſome way or other, although they neither had Chriſt by name, nor yet the letter of the goſpel preached to them? But he miſerably faileth in all; yet let the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the parallel prove how it will, he at a venture, concludeth, that; <hi>As the rock is ſaid in type and repreſentation to have been Chriſt, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yea, and with much more pregnancy, and neereneſſe of ſignification is the goodneſs, and patience, and bounty of God vouchſafed to the heathen to be termed Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>But why ſhould <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> or any man uſurp that licentious way of gloſſing upon the oracles of God, that when the Scripture expreſſely ſaith, the rock was Chriſt; but no where ſaith that the bounty and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of God is Chriſt, yet we ſhall ſay that the patience of God is to be called Chriſt in more pregnant neereneſſe of ſignification then the

            <p n="2">2.

That is, the rock was a type and repreſentation of Chriſt, but is the patience of God ſo? I hope Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſhall never ſee that time wherein theſe types of Chriſt, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Patience and bounty of God ſhall be aboliſhed. How that can be called Chriſt in type and repreſentation, which is for the Churches ſake to continue to the end of the world, that all ſhould come to repentance, I leave to him by his new lights to diſcover to the world.</p>

Now is it according to the method of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> divinity, that the Patience of God, which hath neither natural, nor any inſtituted relation or tendency to ſignifie Chriſt, ſhould be called Chriſt in more neerneſſe of ſignification then thoſe things that were inſtituted Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Jewes; and that in direct reference to Chriſt?</p>
            <p n="4">4. That which he ſaith here, <hi>viz. The patience afforded to the heathen may in a greater neerneſſe of ſignification be termed Chriſt then the rock,</hi> is no more but what he elſewhere uttereth, and to this effect; that the heathen have more pregnant meanes for the believing in Chriſt, then the Jewes, and it is cleare from his conſtant reaſoning; for hee holds that [all that the Jews had afforded them led them but hither, to believe in God, and not in Jeſus Chriſt, except implicitely and interpretatively, as he doth <hi>pag.</hi> 37.38. But the heathen have ſuch meanes, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the patience of God, the light of nature, workes of the creation.] They have now ſufficient meanes of beleiving in Chriſt, and to draw out thence the very ſumme and ſubſtance of the goſpel, as he doth 10, 11, 12, pages of his treatiſe aſſert. But will this paſſe for currant in his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118748:21"/>
that God hath nurtured up the heathen, who are w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>out God and ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, without Chriſt, and hope, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.12. with as pregnant diſcoveries of his ſon, &amp; the ſubſtance of the goſpel, as as he did the Jewiſh church who were a peculiar people to himſelfe? Let henceforth all their priviledges of the circumciſion, mentioned <hi>Romanes</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. vaniſh into ſmoak.</p>
            <p>But to pardon Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> this ſlip, and to look upon his words as not making any compariſon at all with the Jewes, but onely ſimply and abſolutely thus, that the patience of God, may be termed Chriſt. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that he proves how the patience of God without the concurrence of the word to informe us of all things concerning it, can diſcover Chriſt ſo far as that it may be called Chriſt. He attempts to prove it by <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. Becauſe it is there ſaid, <hi>the patience of God leads us to repentance;</hi> but becauſe this Text is produced afterward as a maſter proofe of the marrow of his diſcourſe ſoon after produced. I ſay onely thus much now; the patience of God there ſpoken of, implyeth a concurrent word, and ſo all wayes whereby it may bee known to bee patience; and without which, it cannot diſcover Chriſt; which word it is praeſuppoſed by the termes of the queſtion in hand, the heathen have not: But let all go, Yet</p>
            <p>Laſtly, his reaſon is much blemiſhed in arguing thus, <hi>the Jewes were ſayd to have the goſpel preached, therefore the heathen may;</hi> ſeeing that the Jews had the letter of the goſpel, and Chriſt preached by name, but the Gentiles had not. Therefore let that propriety be granted to the Jews but denyed to the Gentiles, and the heathen whilſt they remain ſo, and he will doe his judgement and reaſon a great deale of right.</p>
            <p>Thus having toyled himſelfe in proving that it may be ſayd in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of language, the heathen have the goſpel preached, although they have not the letter of the goſpel preached, he now is ſitting downe to reap the fruit of thoſe labours, and now ſhews how the heathen come to draw out ſuch Evangelical concluſions concerning Chriſt, and ſalvation by him, without the letter of the goſpel; and indeed, having before bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the bone, here giveth us the marrow of his whole diſcourſe, thus; <hi>God being by the light of nature known, or at leaſt knowable to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely juſt, and bent in hatred againſt ſin, when notwithſtanding hee ſhall expreſſe himſelfe in goodneſſe, and patience, and long ſuffering towards thoſe that know themſelves to be ſinners: Hereby he declares ſufficiently that his juſtice and ſeverity againſt ſin, have been (and this muſt be in reaſon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been in a way proportionably to ſo glorious an effect) ſatisfied, and that he hath ſo far accepted an attonement for them, that in caſe they repent of their ſins, and perſevere in it unto the end, they ſhall eſcape puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo be ſaved; and what is this but (being interpreted) to have <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>A very mercifull ordinary for a heathen man! hee cryes <hi>legit,</hi> when God knoweth he cannot ſpel one ſyllable. Here is a method cut out by a thred, wherein Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is in the right in two things. This
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118748:22"/>
is by interpretation the ſumme of the goſpel; and by this diſcourſe, and regular progreſſe, (if they could make it) they may come to draw out the ſubſtance of the goſpel, but if it be his meaning that a heathen man by the light of nature onely, can make this regular diſcourſe, and diſcover all theſe particulars. I fear it will need probation more then interpretation, and that the world may take a little better notice of it, they ſhall have a ſecond view of it thus: <hi>Men may know by the light of nature onely, that God is juſt, and that it is juſt for him to puniſh ſin ſeverely, then they may read themſelves in the heavens to be ſinners, and Gods ſuſpenſion of wrath to be patience and forbearance, and ſo read in the heavens that his juſtice is ſatisfied; and that in ſuch and ſuch a way, and yet by ſuch a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that admits ſomething to be done on our part ere we can enjoy ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then</hi> (ex multis poſsibilibus) <hi>out of the endleſſe numbers of poſſibles which God might out of his liberty have choſen to be mans duty. The light of nature can preſently faſten upon this duty of repentance, and cull it out from all the reſt, and that in the heavens is ſo legibly engraven the doctrine of perſeverance, that it muſt be alſo upon perſeverance to the end.</hi> A very fair progreſſe, if it had but halfe ſo much truth as colour; but I ſhall preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew that no man can diſcover any one of thoſe by the light of nature onely: this being the foundation of the whole, I ſhall with the greater intention bend my ſelfe to the work, and take them all into examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in order as they lye.</p>
            <p>Firſt he ſaith, <hi>God is knowable by the light of nature to be infinitely juſt, and infinitely bent againſt ſin.</hi> But we find no ſuch thing from any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Scripture: that ſomething of God is to be knowne by the light of nature, the Apoſtle alloweth; but what that is, or how farre this is known by the creation,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20</note> I deſire Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to ſuſpend his vote till we have heard the Apoſtle ſpeak: he telleth us <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things of God are ſeen by the creation, <hi>viz.</hi> his eternal power and Godhead, he goes no further; not that I think that no more of God is ſeen then the Apoſtle mentions; for his wiſdom and goodneſſe, I conceive, is alſo pregnantly ſeen; yet he mentioneth enough to preſerve men from idolatry, and therefore contents himſelfe with ſo much as is ſufficient to his intended purpoſe; yet we muſt obſerve alſo what kind of attributes be mentioneth, namely, ſuch as will naturally, and without any other medium be concluded from the creation, by reſolving all cauſes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects into their originals, as from creation we may preſently reſolve all into power, that can bring a world out of nothing; into wiſedome to make all in ſuch a ſtupendious order; and goodneſſe in giving to every creature ſome rayes of that goodneſſe which is in himſelfe. Wee come now in the ſtate of corruption to gaine the knowledge what God is, by the uſe of medium's, and they muſt be pertinent ones alſo, as thoſe things declare his power in which his power is ſhown. But as for juſtice, where is that ſhown in the creation? Juſtice, and mercy, and long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring are ſuch relative attributes that they are not manifeſted or exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in or upon man, except he be in a further capacity then as meerly created. We ſee God but in <hi>veſtigiis,</hi> in his footſteps in the creatures; now
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118748:22"/>
we cannot make ſo much as a conjecture of him where he hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſet his foot: we may ſee his power in the creation, becauſe in the creation he hath troden in the path of his power: But how ſhall we by the creation or light of nature ſee his juſtice, when creation it ſelfe cannot appear, to be an act of juſtice? If Gods juſtice, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and longſuffering were knowable by the light of nature, why did not God refer him to that when <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired God to ſhew him his glory? or, why needed <hi>Moſes</hi> to ask that boon? We find that his mercy,<note place="margin">Exod. 33.19.34.6, 7</note> longſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as puniſhing iniquity, as pardoning ſin, was not knowable by <hi>Moſes</hi> (a man well verſed in the creation, as a Hiſtorian,) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it was diſcovered and revealed by a higher dictator then nature.<note place="margin">

Suppoſe that a heathen man could know by the light of nature that God is juſt, <hi>(tanquam in actu primo)</hi> yet how can he know that his juſtice conſiſts in being infinitely bent in hatred and ſeverity againſt ſin? Let Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> (who hath greater advantages then the light of nature) ſhew us what natural or neceſſary rule of juſtice there is that tyes God to be infinitely bent in ſeverity againſt ſin. It is ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, that I may affirme it; his wiſdome is the rule of his juſtice: <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe being judg, will over rule this caſe, and he ſaith, <hi>The juſtice of God, is the vertue of God, by which he adminiſters all things rightly, according as his wiſedome thinks convenient.</hi> And <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> (his ſecond) will adjudge the ſame way, that which <hi>Arminius</hi> called general juſtice, he calleth equity, and thus ſaith, <hi>The equity of God is that whereby all things are done according to the rule, counſel, preſcript of his owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> So that what in his wiſedome he preſcribeth to himſelfe to doe, and in his word declareth, that he will doe it according.<note place="margin">Hic videmus ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiam Dei retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buentem ex ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſa promiſſione Dei, &amp; ex juſta comminatione primum locum habere.</note> His juſtice binds him to do that, and that is juſt, and no other thing. So that the juſtice of God which we call retribuent, which directly falleth in with the caſe in hand; retribuent I ſay, either of mercy upon obedience, or puniſhment upon diſobedience, taketh place upon his declarations of thoſe wayes and methods which his wiſedome hath preſented concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſons of men, that is, either his gracious promiſes or ſevere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. And this <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe will award for us, for he ſaith expreſſely thus; <hi>Here we ſee the retribuent juſtice of God, firſt to take place from the gracious promiſes and juſt comminations of himſelf.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.17</note> And this is no more then what we are forced to by the very dint of Scripture, the apoſtle telleth us, <hi>Ro.</hi> 1.17. That the righteouſnes of God was revealed in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, that is, as the Apoſtle there taketh it, a reward of mercy for faith, and a puniſhment of ſeverity for ſin and ſinners, yet both theſe are juſtice. God having preſcribed this way to himſelfe, and declared it to us in the goſpel, that he will ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the faith of believers,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.26</note> and ſeverely puniſh the obſtinacy of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.

to his owne preſcribed rule; that is, to pardon penitent ſinners as well as to puniſh obſtinate ſinners, Hence <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1.1.9. If we confeſſe, he is juſt to forgive; Theſe premiſes I would improve thus far.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To diſcover Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> improvident expreſſions in making Gods juſtice, and his being bent upon ſeverity againſt ſin to be termes equipollent, when his being bent againſt ſeverity, is equally his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, if his wiſedome preſcribe, and to ſo many as he is pleaſed to doe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To prove, that, ſeeing the juſtice of God takes place from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of his wiſedome, and declarations of the ſame, I ſay, that till ſuch preſcriptions and declarations be known, we cannot divine what is juſt or unjuſt for him to doe: Therefore until Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> can prove that the heathen which never had the letter of the goſpel doe yet know thoſe preſcriptions and declarations of the Almighty, whereby he preſcribes himſelfe to be bent in ſeverity againſt ſin, I ſhall conclude, they cannot by the meere light of nature come to know God to be either juſt, or bent in ſeverity againſt ſin. And that they are not ſo intimately acquainted with Gods ſecrets by the light of nature, I am enduced to conclude, becauſe the Apoſtle telleth us, that his righteouſneſſe is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the goſpel, his wrath againſt ſinners is revealed from heaven; but I am taught to think that the ſpirit of God was never found ſo to daily with his owne Oracles, as to ſay, that that which is diſcovered by the light of nature, is either revealed in the goſpel, or from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

The ſecond parcel of this his rational diſcourſe, is this, <hi>they know themſelves to be ſinners:</hi> I ſhall not make much ſtir about this, becauſe in general ſenſe it may be granted, and that from <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences excuſing or accuſing one another: now accuſing conſciences, imply a guilt and acknowledgement of ſome delinquency againſt the law of God. But yet the buſineſſe will be ſomething more difficult as to this pretended diſcourſe of a heathen man; for it is not enough for him to know, that he is a ſinner againſt the law of nature, but againſt ſome poſitive law of God, which was attended with ſuch a ſevere penalty, as dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the death. He muſt know that this law was ſo broken by him as that he becomes guilty of eternal death, and lyeth now concluded under an irrecoverable curſe without a Saviour, and a forfeiture of all that he can call good, which can never by himſelfe be regained; otherwiſe how ſhall Gods providences appear to him under the notion of patience,<note place="margin">Rom. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</note> and ſo the Heathen man muſt be diſtinctly acquainted with the hiſtory of <hi>Adams</hi> integrity, fall, and ruin, Gods law, mans ſin, and mans curſe, and is this to be done meerly by the light of nature? Certainely then the Apoſtle took too much paines to convince them, that both Jewes and Gentiles were under ſin. In the firſt part of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> how he beateth the ayre to read ſuch ſuperfluous Lectures to them, as he doth in the 5th Chapter, that by one man ſin entered, and by ſin death, in whom we all have ſinned: when all this and much more is

knowne by the meer light of nature and common providences. Againe certainely, then the words of the Apoſtle want weight, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.19</note> What the law ſaith, (that is the poſitive) it ſaith to them that are under the law, that all mouths may be ſtopped, and the whole world become guilty before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. if that all mens mouths may be ſtopped, &amp; they be found guilty before God by the dictate and light of nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third parcel of this diſcourſe, <hi>They ſee him expreſſe himſelfe in patience, goodneſſe and bounty.</hi> I ſuppoſe ſtill he intends this by the light of nature: but then I wonder why he thus fallaciouſly ſhuffles in termes of a Heterogenious nature; that may well be admitted in his ſenſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand to gaine credence to that which cannot upon the intereſt of truth be received; goodneſſe and bounty he ſheweth in the creation;<note place="margin">Praedeſtinatio non tantum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta eſt ex bonita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſimpliciter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Goodneſſe ſimply conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered was reached out to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, but patience is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to any but to ſinners: this <hi>Arminius</hi> granteth, when hee trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth upon predeſtination, ſaying thus: <hi>Predeſtination is not made out of meer goodneſſe abſolutely conſidered, which is a communicating of himſelfe to the creatures; but it is after the manner of mercy iſſuing from compaſſion towards men in miſery; and of patience and longanimity towards them that hang back and hearken not to his call.</hi> So that goodneſſe and patience are diſtinguiſhable in their owne judgement; therefore it will not follow, that becauſe they may diſcover goodneſſe, therefore they may diſcover patience and forbearance by the light of nature. This hath ſuch a dependence upon the former, that I ſay onely thus much here, that except an heathen man can ſee himſelfe a ſinner, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded under the weight of ſuch a curſed death, he cannot ſee any act of God to be Patience.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth ſtep in his pretended rational diſcourſe, is this; <hi>This teſtifieth and delareth that his juſtice and ſeverity againſt ſin hath been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and that he hath received an attonement.</hi> But I ſay, on the other ſide, that let him take all the forementioned particulars for granted: yet how do they rationally declare a ſatisfaction or an attonement? There is no ſmal difference between theſe two; though patience did argue an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, yet it doth not, ſatisfaction: but I ſay it doth neither. Firſt, not attonement, execution is ſometimes deferd, not becauſe the malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour is pardoned, but only reprieved. A provoked maſter is long ere he take an accompt, and ſmite; not becauſe he hath remitted the crime, but rather becauſe he would have the rounder ſcore, and give the greater ſtroak.

            <q>
               <p>If the patience of God afforded to obſtinate ſinners doth not infer that he hath received an attonement for their obſtinacy, then the patience of God extended to heathens cannot infer that God hath received an attonement for their ſins.</p>
               <p>But the patienc of God extended to obſtinate ſinners doth not rationally infer that he hath received an attonement for that their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy.</p>

            </q>
            <p>The propoſition is ground thus; if patience doth of it ſelfe infer an attonement, then it muſt by the rules of reaſon follow, that he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for all thoſe ſins and obliquities, in reference to which he is ſaid to be patient.<note place="margin">Rom. 9, 22.</note> The minor I prove by <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. where the Apoſtle ſaith,<note n="a" place="margin">Vaſa irae non ſunt omnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuè peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, ſed ex mii prae caeteros pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catores, qui in omnibus pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis iram ſibi the ſaurizant acindè interitui proximi ſunt. <hi>Corv. in Mal.</hi> Cap, 14 Sect. 11.</note> what if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and make his power known, endureth the veſſels of wrath ſitted for deſtruction with much patience?

                  </p>
               </note> and the rather, becauſe their teſtimony is ſomething convincing, to that be it ſo as they would have it, that theſe veſſels of wrath are, as <hi>Corvinus</hi> ſaith, <hi>not ſinners barely, but ſuch as are in ſinning beyond the reſt, and by their enormous courſes treaſure up wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves.</hi> Or as <hi>Arminius, not onely ſuch as tranſgreſſe, but tranſgreſſing perſiſt.</hi> Nay, let them be what they will, who are here called veſſels of wrath, the buſineſſ: will not ſtick here: but let us conſider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that he then endures with much patience. When; Let <hi>Corvinus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſpeak; <hi>Then doth God beare with much patience the veſſels of wrath, when he at the ſame time willeth to powre out his wrath mightily upon them.</hi> Now this is clear both by teſtimony of the Scriptures and our adverſaries, that God affordeth much patience to the veſſels of wrath, then when he willeth to powre out his wrath mightily. I demand, to what end is that patience afforded? <hi>Arminius</hi> will gratifie us with what we deſired. <hi>In excuſability is rather the event then the end of patience and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, except it be to the obſtinate and refractory.</hi> So that he grants that to the obſtinate and veſſels of wrath, his end is to make them the more inexcuſable, To conclude then, doth God will to powre forth his wrath mightily at the ſame time, and upon the ſame perſon, when, and for whom he hath received an attonement? Indeed this often paſſeth for one of <hi>Mr. Goodwins</hi> Oracles, but never for an Oracle of Gods. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the attonement, and a will to powre forth his wrath mightily, are inconſiſtent, but patience and that will to powre forth his wrath may feed and lye downe together. By this I prove that patience doth no waies infer an attonement.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe it could infer an attonement, yet could not diſcover a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; there are many wayes for God to be attoned to man, and not to exact or receive ſatisfaction, as it is ſtrictly taken for receiving the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the law, either of the ſurety or of the principal. It is ſtrange to me that the dimme light of nature ſhould ſo preſently diſcover that God could not be attoned to man without mans ſatisfaction, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that this queſtion, <hi>viz. (Whether God could pardon ſin and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118748:24"/>

And thoſe of <hi>Mr. Goodwins</hi> own ſide have given this for granted, that <hi>if the right power of ſaving be conſidered abſolutely in God, then God could ſave a ſinner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſatisfaction of Chriſt.</hi> And I deſire Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> who hath more then natural light, ſo far to patronize his heathen clyents, as to educe ſome of thoſe evidences by which the patience of God inferreth ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Nay, ſo far is it on the other ſide, that it cannot appeare conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with reaſon, that any perſon ſhould have received ſatisfaction and yet be properly ſayd to be patient; if any man have received ſo much as juſtice and equity can require, Hee cannot bee ſayd to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe patience: this is a myſtery into which <hi>Mr. Goodwins</hi> doctrine doth neceſſarily involve him, which I expect he ſhould unfold without plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the heifer of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth ſtep to this pretended rational diſcourſe is this, <hi>they may know that he hath ſo far accepted an attonement for him, that if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their former ſins, and in repentance perſevere unto the end, they ſhall eſcape puniſhment, and ſo be ſaved.</hi> The progreſſe is very high, not only to attonement and ſatisfaction themſelves, but to their ſeveral modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and reſtrictions.

            <p n="2">2.

            <p>Thus have I touched upon every parcel of his pretended rational diſcourſe, that a heathen may (as he ſaith) make by the light of nature, and after examination it appears that without his officious ſuggeſtion, hee could not read one ſyllable of it.

            <p>But becauſe Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> knoweth that it matters not what negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and buſiy heads aſſert, but how they prove, he gives us a text or two, or ſome few to prove all this, which he ſeemes to pretend a ſerious exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of; I ſhall do the like, and thereby be enabled to ſurvey both his underſtanding and ingenuity at once.

Now if it appeare, that it be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of either, the Jews, or thoſe Gentiles that were called by the Goſpel, then will it be a very impertinent proofe to fortifie his aſſertion, which is, that thoſe that never had the letter of the Goſpel are yet bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive. And by the ducture of the method of the Apoſtle I affirme. Firſt, that that <hi>hearing</hi> by which he ſaith faith cometh, is not the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ſound of the heavens, but of the Goſpel orally preached.

Therefore certainely this text is not meant of the ſound of the heavens, but of the goſpel, and that as preached by the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And is not his owne judgement as cleare? if we may gather his judgement out of his writings, and it will appeare a meer forgery againſt a cleare text adjudged by the expreſſions that come from his owne pen. To this purpoſe I deſire Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to conſult the 32, 33, 34. pages of his treatiſe,<note place="margin">pag. 32, 33, 34.</note> where he takes occaſion to handle this very text, but very unhandſomely for his purpoſe, in which pages hee makes an abrupt tranſiſion from his propounded buſineſſe in page 31.<note place="margin">pag. 31.</note> to the oral preaching of the Goſpel by the Apoſtles, and his intention is to prove
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118748:27"/>
that their preaching of it in ſome eminent places is virtually and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructively the preaching of it to the whole world, as he ſaith <hi>pag.</hi> 34.

Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaith, that the import of thoſe interogatories, is this; <hi>That they were not like to hear of God, or of Jeſus Chriſt in the goſpel, had there not been ſome one or more to have preached &amp; publiſhed it to the world.</hi> Thus in <hi>pag</hi> 33. and when in <hi>pag.</hi> the thirty fourth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 33</note> he aſſerts that the Apoſtles had orally preached the Goſpel virtually and conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively through the whole world, he proves it by this very text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. <hi>verily their ſound is gone out through the world.</hi> But certainely if this text, <hi>pag.</hi> 34. clearely ſignifies the conſtructive oral preaching to the whole world by the Apoſtles, it is very weakly produced in the 10. <hi>pag.</hi> to prove that the <hi>hearing</hi> there mentioned is the hearing of the ſound of the heavens. And if he ſay in one place, that the text is meant of the Apoſtles preaching; I wonder he is of ſuch an untamed fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to forge ſuch a ſenſe againſt the text, as to ſay that by <hi>hearing,</hi> is meant the hearing of the ſound of the heavens, and the day, and the night.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His interpretation is a meer forgery againſt a cleare text, if we look onely to the genius of the whole chapter, which undoubtedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds of the oral preaching of the goſpel, as <hi>ver.</hi> 8. this is the word of faith which we preach; and <hi>ver.</hi> 11 it is the <hi>ſcripture,</hi> not the <hi>heavens</hi> that ſpeak: and thus till it come to <hi>ver.</hi> 14. to thoſe interogatories, <hi>how ſhal they believe on him in whom they have not heard? how ſhall they heare without a preacher?</hi> And that all theſe interogatories are underſtood of the oral preaching of the goſpel, if Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> did not acknowledge it <hi>pag.</hi> 31, 32. I ſhould eaſily prove it. Some I confeſſe may be ſo perverſe, but none ſo blind as to think that thoſe words, <hi>(preaching,) (hearing,) (word,) (goſpel,) (believing,)</hi> ſo often repeated in this chapter, are not underſtood, and relate to the oral preaching of the Goſpel, and in the letter of it. And thus till he produce further proofe on all hands, we ſhall conclude his interpretation a meer forgery againſt a clear text, and ſo adjudged againſt him by the current of interpreters, the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the beſt of his owne ſide, his own expreſſes, and the cleare geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of the whole chapter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Having examined his interpretation, I proceed to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and illuſtration of his interpretation: He would eſtabliſh it by affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that <hi>the voice of the heavens, and the night, and the day, and the words which they ſpeak, are the words of eternal life, as well as thoſe which Chriſt himſelfe ſpake when he was upon earth:</hi> which I charged with impious blaſphemy, and proceed thus to make it good. If to affirme any thing from Chriſt that derogateth either from the dignity of his perſon or office, be truely to be termed blaſphemy, then they may be termed ſo; for herein he doth both advance the creatures into the Chaire of Chriſt, and reduce Chriſt into the ranke of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

We find a dicotomy in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2:2. of Gods ſpeaking by the prophets, and ſpeaking by his Son; but of his ſpeaking the things of the goſpel by the heavens, no where.

Nay, I intreat Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to conſider whether he doth not by this introduce a needleſneſſe and uſeleſneſſe of Chriſt coming to diſcover the myſteries of the goſpel to the Gentiles, or of any oral preaching thereof, either to Jew or Gentile, if that in the heavens and the creatures there be ſo much ſeen of the Goſpel, as to make men wiſe unto ſalvation. And ſo good old <hi>Simeon</hi> muſt ſtand charged rather with dotage then devotion, in waiting for Chriſt to be the light of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.

If that both theſe may be as truly recorded of the book of the creatures, as of the book of the Scriptures. Laſtly, let Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> upon better thoughts conſider, whether the creatures, and the motions of the heavens be truly and properly ſaid to carry in them the words of eternal life at all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We find the Scriptures, the words which Chriſt and his Apoſtles orally preached to the world, to be called the <hi>word of Life. Phil.</hi> 2.16. ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.63. ["the words which I ſpeak unto you are life.] And the <hi>words of eternal life,</hi> in many texts. But I intreat Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one text, that either expreſſely, or by intimation calls the ſound of the heavens ſo. Me thinks his reaſon ſhould beſpeak it too great preſumption for any man to make the words of Chriſt to bee no more the words of eternal life, then the ſound of the heavens, which never in Scripture are honoured with that dignifying title.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The words of eternal life muſt diſcover not only God, but Chriſt, without the knowledg of both, no ſalvation, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.3. ["This is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal "to know God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.] But how long
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118748:28"/>
long will it be ere he prove that the creatures can give the knowledge of Chriſt. I expect that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> give me ſome pertinent Scriptures to prove it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20 <hi>Act.</hi> 17.27. go no further then <hi>the glorie of God, the inviſible things of God,</hi> and <hi>that they might ſeek after God:</hi> but that the creatures of themſelves diſcover a Chriſt, the Scriptures ſay no where.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The words of eternal life are the charter and <hi>magna charta</hi> of the Church. Hence he knowes it is a rule, <hi>extra eccleſiam nulla ſalus:</hi> and alſo that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.47. ["The Lord added to the "Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.] To be brought into the Church, was to be brought <hi>(in ſeriem ſalvandorum)</hi> and both by the word of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. Then if the heavens declare the words of eternal life, either that diſtinction betwixt the church of Chriſt and them that are without, falls to the ground, or elſe the word of eternal life is given, as the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary means to bring men to faith in Jeſus Chriſt, to others, beſides the Church of God. And then what tranſcendent love is there in Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Church, in waſhing of it with water by the <hi>word? Eph,</hi> 5.25, 26</p>
            <p n="4">4. The words of eternal life muſt convert the ſoule, open the eyes, make wiſe the ſimple, otherwiſe they are not to bee called the words of eternal life. But if Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſay that the creatures and voice of the heavens doe convert the ſoule, &amp;c. then let him conſider whether hee doth not overthrow that plaine diſtinction of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.4. 6, 7, 8. where he ſaith, the heavens declare the glory of God, and the law converteth the ſoule. He ſpeaketh not of converting the ſoule, til he paſſeth by the heavens, and ſpeaketh of the law of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The word of eternal life is the ordinary meanes which God hath appointed to bring men to life. But if Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſay, that the heavens and the creatures are the ordinary way to bring men to ſalvation, then he muſt prove where God hath ſo appointed them, and alſo cleare it to us, that we are brought to heaven and life by the creatures as well as by the Goſpel orally diſpenſed. Till theſe things be cleared, I cannot but judge that the creatures cannot afford of themſelves the words of eternal life. And then for Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to ſay that the voyce of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are the words of eternal life; as well as thoſe that Chriſt himſelfe ſpake, is in effect, to ſay that the words that Chriſt ſpake are not the words of eternal life at all; which how blaſphemous it is againſt Jeſus Chriſt the Prophet of his Church, let the world judge.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I charged his reaſon with weakneſſe and abſurdity; it is this, He meaneth the voice of the heavens, becauſe the Apoſtle uſeth this text, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.4. which words by the Pſalmiſt are ſpoken of the heavens. It is very ſtrange to me that a man of ſuch a ſearching judgement as Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> ſhould be driven upon ſuch a rock by this inconſiderable guſt, and if there be (with him) ſo much weight in thoſe words, as to weigh downe all interpreters, the judgement of his owne ſide, his owne firſt-born, the natural genius of the text, hee may by his prejudice caſt the ſcale; but I am confident he cannot give good weight, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering there are ſo many plauſible wayes to avoid any ſuch inference.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:118748:29"/>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Rivet,</hi> who come the neareſt his minde, and think that the latter clauſe of <hi>verſe</hi> 15, is meant of the heavens; yet that thoſe words are produced by the Apoſtle onely to prove, that it is no ſtrange thing that the Gentiles ſhould have the goſpel, becauſe he had done ſo much for them in the creatures; and they are ſo far from excluding the heavens of the letter of the goſpel, that they urge it to be cleare that this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Have they not heard?</hi> is to be underſtood of the letter of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>Others there are that are no whit of his mind, and think that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth onely allude to thoſe words, and adapt them to his owne purpoſe. All ſuppoſing this to be the drift of the apoſtle, to prove that the gentiles had the letter of the goſpel; the drift alſo of the Apoſtle in theſe words,<note place="margin">Oratorio utitur, &amp; evocat teſtem ex ipſorum lege. Soto domin. in loc.</note> 
               <hi>their voice is gone out,</hi> is to confirme it, and then he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Pſalmiſts words, not as meaning the heavens, or their words, but he ſpeaketh of the goſpel in theſe expreſſions, that hee might convince the Jewes the better, as by a teſtimony out of their owne law; As <hi>Soto</hi> the Dominican in his Commentary.<note n="b" place="margin">Willet in hex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apl. in loc.</note> Others will tell him, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle uſed theſe words, although he be treating of the goſpel in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, to let them ſee that in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 19.4. it was the prophecy, but in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. the accompliſhment. Thus <hi>Willet</hi> in his <hi>Hexapla.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paraus</hi> and <hi>Soto</hi> tell us, that though he be treating of the goſpel yet he uſeth theſe words of the Pſalmiſt. either <note n="c" place="margin">Pari velocitate quâ ſol totum or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem permeavit, tuba etiam evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica per totum orbem praeluſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. <hi>Soto</hi> &amp; <hi>Paraus in loc.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>à pari,</hi> from the like, that is, With the like ſwiftneſſe that the Sun runs his courſe, doth the trumpet of the goſpel run through the world; or elſe <hi>à minori ad majus,</hi> from the leſſe to the greater, thus, if he gave them the voice of the heavens, he would give them the goſpel. And moſt interpreters part their thoughts into an alluſion, or allegory, or metaphor, as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> gives us a hint; any of which ſheweth the invalidity of <hi>Mr, Goodwins</hi> infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>But if theſe doe not ſatisfie, in the next place, I ſay it is a hard thing for him to prove that the Apoſtle citeth purpoſely theſe words as the text of the Pſalmiſt, and not rather onely aſſerts his owne buſineſſe in the Pſalmiſts expreſſions. He ſaith indeed, <hi>the ſound of them,</hi> but of whom? here is the queſtion; but <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> ſaith, the ſound of the <hi>heavens,</hi> but it is with no colour of reaſon; there had not one word paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the heavens, and therefore it is againſt reaſon to refer the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to an unknowne anticedent, when there is one viſible. <hi>Toſſanus,</hi> if <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> will accept of reaſonable ſatisfaction, ſaith ſomething to this purpoſe; <note n="d" place="margin">Ait ſimpliciter ſonus eorum ivit. <hi>i. e.</hi> evangelizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum pacem ſuper montibus, de qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſupra egerit, <hi>Toſſanus in loc.

               </note> 
               <hi>He ſaith ſimply and onely, the ſound of them is gone forth, that is of thoſe that bring glad tidings of peace, of whom he had before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> He doth not ſay, (as it is written) or thus (the Scripture ſaith,) as if he intended to cite the words of the Pſalmiſt for his own purpoſe, but ſpeaks them as his own expreſſes, <hi>the ſound of them,</hi> that is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles that bring the glad tidings of peace: thus the Remonſtrants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves give it us; they conſent to read the words roundly thus, in ſtead of <hi>eorum ſonus,</hi> they read it <hi>Apoſtolorum ſonus;</hi> not the ſound of them, but the ſound of the Apoſtles: and why they do ſo, let him examine at his leiſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:118748:29"/>And if all this doe not ſatisfie, let him examine whether his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity doth not ſerve him at this turn, to ſee that the Apoſtle uſeth the expreſſions of the Prophets; not to prove and aſſert that in which they were originally concerned; but that which he is to carry on a new: as ſpeaking of almes, and contributions for the Saints,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 85.1.</note> he ſaith hee would have all things carryed on by an equality, that the abundance of the one might be the ſupply of the other, as it is written, <hi>He that gathered much bad nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack.</hi> Will Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> make this inference, that the Apoſtle in <hi>verſe</hi> 14. ſpeaketh of gathering and diſtributing <hi>Manna</hi> to the Saints, becauſe he uſeth theſe expreſſes of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 15, <hi>verſe,</hi> which were originally ſpoken in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Mannah?</hi> Is it not cleare, that thoſe words which <hi>Moſes</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth concerning <hi>Manna,</hi> the Apoſtle adapts them to his owne buſineſſe of almes.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>David</hi> ſpake of the outward proſperity and affluence of his enemies in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 69.22. <hi>Let their table become a ſnare:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 69.22 Rom. 11.8, 9</note> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle adapts them to prove, that the goſpel, their ſpiritual food, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſnare to the Jew, <hi>Ro.</hi> 11.8, 9. The many thouſands that did not bow their knee to <hi>Baal</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Elijah,</hi> the Apoſtle uſeth to prove the reſerve that God had in the Apoſtles times amongſt the Jewes that were not carried downe the general deluge of infidelity,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.4</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.4. Thoſe words that were originally ſpoken of the righteouſneſſe of the law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.12. <hi>Paul</hi> applyed to the righteouſneſſe of faith,<note place="margin">Deut. 30.12 Rom. 10.6, 7, 8</note>

               <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. And if ſo many inſtances appeare near theſe words in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt us, let Mr, <hi>Goodwin</hi> give us ſome ſolid reaſon why theſe words that were originally ſpoken of the ſound of the heavens, may not be by the Apoſtles adapted and fitted to expreſſe the ſound of the goſpel in the letter of it. Thus have I ſpent much time, and put the reader to much trouble, becauſe I would detect the forgery, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, &amp; abſurdity that lye hid in this interpretation of <hi>Mr. Goodwin,</hi> and that it might appeare how weakly and praepoſterouſly this text, that clearely importeth and affirmeth that the gentiles had the letter of the goſpel, is produced to prove that they are bound to believe in Chriſt, that never had the letter of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>The ſecond text he produced to prove his aſſertion, is in <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16, 17. "He left them not without witneſſe, in that he did them good, "gave them raine from heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons. In which, if he had been pleaſed to reduce his thoughts to any argumentative form, they would more clearely have diſcovered themſelves: but hee puts his reader to a double task, both to find out his argument, and then to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it. It ſeemeth to be but a wild inference, He gave them rain and fruitful ſeaſons, and left not himſelfe without witneſſe, Therfore they are bound to believe in Chriſt that have not the letter of the goſpel. True indeed, but it is chiefly inquirable, which are the witneſſes of God,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118748:30"/>
and what it was that they witneſſed concerning him; if <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> can prove that thoſe witneſſes there ſpoken of did witneſſe a Chriſt, and a mediatour, and an attonement made by him, then Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> may carry the cauſe: but if not, this place is very vainly produced to prove that they are bound to believe in Chriſt that have nothing but theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: To clear the buſineſſe, he produceth two things under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>doubtleſſe;</hi> but both very obnoxious to ſcruples, not eaſily ſatisfied; the firſt, runneth thus.</p>
            <p>[<q>Doubtleſſe he doth not ſpeak here of his Godhead, nor power, nor wiſedome, as if God left not himſelfe without witneſſe of theſe; the works of creation diſtinct from providence, are ſufficient witneſſes of theſe, according to the tenour of <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.</q>] But here is nothing leſſe out of doubt then this: and to the due underſtanding of it, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, Firſt, to conſider the occaſion of theſe words, which wil make a fair way to the diſcovering the meaning of them.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of them was the idolatry of the men of <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to worſhip the Apoſtles under the notion of Gods; upon this occaſion he doth two things; Firſt, lets them ſee that they ought not to worſhip them, which he doth in the 15. <hi>verſe</hi> by two pregnant argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 1. The Apoſtles were men of like paſſions with them. 2. They were but the inſtruments of God to turne them to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God. Secondly, his task is to prove that they ſhould worſhip the true and the living God; now if this be his deſign, to prove God to be the true God whom they ought to worſhip, then all thoſe things there mentioned, muſt reaſonably be underſtood of ſuch things as the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures give us to evince his deity, and ſo by them to prove that he is to be worſhipped: And I conceive, that nothing but that which treateth of, and manifeſteth his Godhead is a fit medium for any to uſe to take off ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters from their vanity, to the true God. Beſides, will Mr, <hi>Goodwin</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in this, that the Apoſtle doubtleſſe doth not here treat of his Godhead? What one word is there in the three verſes alledged, 15, 16, 17. which may not be called a fit medium to prove his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Doth he not ſay in general, that he is <hi>(living God?)</hi> 2. Doth he not ſay, <hi>(which made the heavens and the earth?)</hi> and are not theſe words an expreſſe of his power? 3. Doth he not ſay, that he <hi>ſuffered all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi> and are not theſe an expreſſe of his ſoveraignty and power over the creatures, without which he could not properly be ſayd to ſuffer them? And 4, Doth he not ſay, he <hi>did them good, and gave them fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeaſons?</hi> and are not theſe an expreſſe of his goodneſſe, and that he is, <hi>principium et fons omnis boni,</hi> the principle and Fountaine of all good? which clearly evinceth his diety. And ſeeing the apoſtle produceth nothing but what is very apt and fit to prove the diety and godhead of the Almighty; it is a ſtrong <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nducement to me to think that he produced all thoſe particulars for that every end and purpoſe. And doth he not herein keep a juſt parallel to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>mſelfe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. and in <hi>Acts</hi> 17.23, 24, 25. In all the three pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hi the occaſion is the ſame,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118748:30"/>
namely, idolatry; the end the ſame, to preſerve them from idolatry; that which he preſſeth is the ſame, namely, God making the earth and all things therein; the end is the ſame: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. ſaith, that they might be inexcuſable when they turned the truth of God into a lye. <hi>Acts</hi> 14, ſaith, that he left not himſelfe without witneſſe. And <hi>Act</hi> 17.23, 24. ſaith, that by groping after him they might find him; now all theſe three come to one &amp; the ſame iſſue; when men by groping after him, find him in his works, then he hath his witneſſes; and when he hath his witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, idolaters are without excuſe; and then what can be more probable then this, that all three places tend to evince the the ſame thing, that is, the Godhead and diety of the true God? And I intreate Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to conſider the Apoſtle in. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.23, 24. and tel me whether he do not purpoſely in thoſe expreſſions evince the diety. In the 23. <hi>verſe</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that God which yee ignorantly worſhip, him doe I declare to you.</hi> And in the cloſe in <hi>verſe</hi> 30. that <hi>they might not think the godhead was like unto gold and ſilver, or ſtones graven by mans device;</hi> are not theſe pregnant proofes that the apoſtle doth purpoſely and pertinently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the godhead and diety? But by what arguments doth he doe it? not onely by his power in making all things, as in <hi>ver.</hi> 24, but in this, that he giveth to all life and breath <hi>(and all things.)</hi> And what is this leſſe then his giving them raine and fruitful ſeaſons? and if it appeare that his giving all things be brought to prove a diety in the 17. chapter, upon what accompt of reaſon is it doubtleſſe, that his giving fruitful ſeaſons is not urged in chap. 14. and to evince the very ſame thing?</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>(doubtleſſe)</hi> that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> preſumeth is this; <hi>doubtleſs the thing that God intended ſhould be witneſſed on his behalfe, was ſomething more ſecret and out of the way of mens common thoughts and apprehenſions; and particularly it was that gracious and good affection that he beareth to men in Chriſt, his inclinations to peace with them upon their repentance.</hi> That it was ſomething out of the way of mens commen thoughts and apprehenſions, I wil eaſily grant him? but wil it be any thing further off from proving it to be only his deity and godhead? Gods not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any thing, receiving of nothing, but communicating all things to the creature, and ſo being the author and fountain of all good, theſe are as pregnant proofes of a deity and godhead as any, and given by the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.25. And theſe alſo are beyond the common thoughts of man; for if Iſrael, who had the clear manifeſtations of God in his word, did not yet know that God gave her corne, and wine, and oyle, but that they came from her lovers; <hi>Hoſ,</hi> 2.5, 7, 8. how much more may it be beyond the common thoughts of the heathen; that their fruitful ſeaſons come from God, rather then from their idols, and ſo to be more obfirmed in their idolatry? So that it doth not appear that it is not the Godhead, becauſe it is out of the way of mens common thoughts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſaith, <hi>It was particularly the good affection which he beareth to men in Chriſt Jeſus, his inclinations to peace upon repentance.</hi> But what one expreſſion in all that Text that neceſſarily inferreth this? Let
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118748:31"/>
him ſhew it, and I have done; he uſeth indeed two reaſons to prove it.</p>
            <p>His firſt reaſon is, becauſe <hi>ſuch witneſſes are onely proper to teſtifie grace and love, and the deſire of the good of thoſe to whom they are given, in him that giveth them.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="1">1. Will not his underſtanding ſerve him to ſee them as pregnant teſtimonies of his deity, and the Godhead? doe not raine and fruitfull ſeaſons, and works of providence as clearly hold forth the eternal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſedome of God as any other thing? Let him conſult with <hi>Job</hi> 38.25, 26. Where God expoſtulateth with <hi>Job</hi> about thoſe parcels of the creation and providence, and preſſeth both, as arguments both of his power and of his wiſedome, in the water courſes of heavens, in cauſing it to raine, and by it the tender bud to bring forth; in that he was a father to the rain, &amp; begot the drops of dew; and found a womb of the ice, and bindeth the influences of the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> and guides <hi>Arctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> with his ſons, and hath ſo ſet the ordinances of heaven in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe: is there not both power and wiſedome ſeen in that circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar providence? <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2 laſt. <hi>I wil heare the heavens, and they ſhal heare the earth, &amp;c.</hi> Let him conſider the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, cap.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 22. where he ſaith, <hi>are there any of the vanities of the nations that can give raine? Art not thou he? therefore we wil wait upon thee.</hi> What will Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſay to this? are not ſhowres and raine fit and proper teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Gods power, and of his deity, and ſo pertinent to call them off from idols to the living God? Why doth he reaſſume that impious licence to charge the Scriptures, and holy pen-men thereof, with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and improper evidences? they frequently produce raine, ſhowres and fruitfull ſeaſons, as evidences of power and wiſedome; but Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaith that they are not proper Teſtimonies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It plainely appeares they alwayes prove his power and wiſedom, but where doth he once prove that they are proper to teſtifie grace and love in Jeſus Chriſt? Let him take the wiſeman along with him, and he will tell him, that no man can know either love or hatred, ſo neither thoughts of good or hurt by theſe outward things. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1, 2. Hee cauſeth them all to fall upon all without exception. Nay, if any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, moſt on thoſe to whom he hath the leaſt thoughts of good in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. <hi>Men of the world, whoſe belly thou filleſt with thy hidden treaſures.</hi> To uſe no more but this, thoſe who are obſtinate and incorrigible in ſin, and ſo by God are given up to a reprobate ſenſe, and by his conſequent will are for that obſtinacy deſtined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſo that God now hateth them; yet do theſe, ſo long as they live upon earth, enjoy raine and fruitful ſeaſons. But will Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſay that they are proper evidences of Gods love, and deſire of their good, and inclinations to peace upon repentance? But now I am by a faire occaſion caſt upon a point of ſome concernement in the controverſie betwixt Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> and us; and that is, the ſufficiency in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alone to bring men to believe in Chriſt. Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with Mr, <hi>Simpſon</hi> was very aſſertive of this, that the heathen

had ſufficient means to bring to faith in Jeſus Chriſt; but he was very unwilling to diſcover what that ſufficient means of faith is, and I blame him not; but he is ſomething more daring in this treatiſe, and affirmes that the raine and fruitful ſeaſons can diſcover the Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and bring men to faith in him, they being proper onely to teſtifie a reconcilement and attonement in Chriſt; but I find not Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in one ſyllable inclining to prove it by good demonſtrative reaſon. I ſhall therefore addreſſe to accoaſt him with an Argument or two, to prove that raine and fruitful ſeaſons are no proper teſtimonies of the mercy of God in Chriſt, or an attonement and ſatisfaction made by him.

               <q>If the Apoſtle ſpeak as much in all reſpects elſewhere, and yet not for that end, or expecting that improvment, that men ſhould diſcover a Saviour and a Mediator, Then it is probable that in this text <hi>Act.</hi> 14. he doth not expect ſuch an improvement as to diſcover a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſo by conſequence thoſe things here mentioned, are not fit and proper teſtimonies thereof.</q>

            <p>But the former is true. Therefore the latter is true.</p>
            <p>Certainely the Apoſtle would have that in his eye as the end, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the higheſt improvement to which thoſe meanes afforded are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and adapted. Now let us ſee in <hi>Acts</hi> 17.24, 25, 26, 27. when <hi>Paul</hi> met with the idolatry of them at <hi>Athens,</hi> he takes occaſion to preach the ſame ſermon as to them, at <hi>Lyſtra;</hi> onely the place is different, all things elſe alike; the occaſion the ſame, their idolatry; the end the ſame, to reſtraine them from it, to turne them from their vanities to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God; the Sermon the ſame, in both he preached the power of God in the creation; in both he preached the power of God in the works of providence. Nay, in this text <hi>Act.</hi> 17.24, 25. hee goeth ſomething further in expreſſions of providence then in <hi>Acts</hi> 14. for herein he ſaith only, [he giveth raine and fruitfull ſeaſons, and filleth the hearts of men with food &amp; gladneſſe.] But <hi>Act.</hi> 17.24, 25. ſaith, [he giveth all things;] but what is the improvement that the Apoſtle aims at, or any man can rationally expect from theſe things! The Apoſtle tells us, ["That they might ſeek the Lord, <gap reason="foreign">

That the perſon that theſe are propounded to diſcover, is not Jeſus Chriſt the mediator, but the Lord God the party offended; it was not to diſcover an attonement or ſatisfaction, but a deity; not to bring men in to believe in Chriſt, or repent of their idolatry, but onely to reſtraine them further perſiſtence in idolatry. 2. Conſider, that it is not clearely to ſee God, and roundly to draw out the moſt intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions concerning him, but onely, <gap reason="foreign">

It is not the evaſion of <hi>Corvinus</hi> that will ſerve his turne, who being by his adverſary preſt with this Text, expounds it thus; (<note n="b" place="margin">Gentes fuerunt ſine Chriſto, quia Chriſtum ſibi non ſperabant; &amp; ſpem non habu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe dicuntur, quia non ſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt in promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiones Judris fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctas. <hi>Corvin. in Mol. cap.</hi> 39. §. 4.</note>) <hi>The nations were without Chriſt, in that they did not hope in Chriſt; and they were without hope, in that they did not hope in thoſe promiſes that were made to the Jews:</hi> but this comes farre ſhort of ſatisfaction. For firſt, theſe words, <hi>in that they did not hope in Chriſt for themſelves,</hi> are no rational interpretation of his phraſe, <hi>being without Chriſt.</hi> For their being without Chriſt, did diſtinguiſh the Gentiles from the Jewes; but it was not the want of the act of hope in Chriſt that diſtinguiſhed the gentiles from the Jews; becauſe in this they were alike: many among the Jews did not actually hope in Chriſt, which was the cauſe of their final rejection, but that which differenced them was their being <hi>(ſine fundamento ſpei)</hi> without the foundation of hope, that is, the diſcovery of Chriſt in the promiſes, And this will be more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, if we conſider what it was that made them one, and tooke away this difference betwixt the Jew and the Gentile; not the hope of the Gentiles in the promiſes that were peculiar to the Jewes, this was not pertinent to them as Gentiles, but as Proſelites; but their hope in the promiſes made to themſelves, as appeares in the 13. and 17. <hi>verſes,</hi> where the Apoſtle affirms that thoſe that were a farre off are made nigh, yea, and made one with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that was by having the goſpel preached to them that were a farre off, as to them that were nigh. Now if their
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118748:33"/>
oneneſſe with the Jew lay in this, that they had the ſame promiſes of Chriſt in the goſpel, and ſo the ſame foundation of hope, (ſame, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically, I mean, not numerically) it will follow that their difference lay in this, that the Jewes had the foundation of hope in the promiſes, but the Gentiles none, ſo without Chriſt and without hope: without Chriſt, becauſe without the knowledge of Chriſt; without hope, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the foundation and ground of hope. But how can thoſe that have Chriſt preached, and life upon repentance, and the ſumme of the goſpel diſcovered, any ways be ſayd in this ſenſe to be either without Chriſt, or without hope? Neither ſecondly, is this enough to render them in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral without hope, becauſe they did not hope in the promiſes made to the Jewes. What if they did not? yet if they had diſcoveryes of Chriſt and life upon repentance, and the ſumme of the Goſpel preached ſome other way, eſpecially in a ſaving way, it is enough to beſpeak them not without hope; which untill I receive further ſatisfaction, muſt prevaile with me to think that the heathen have not ſuch diſcoveries by the fruitful ſeaſons, becauſe they are ſaid to be without hope.</p>

meanes of faith in Jeſus, leaſt he at unawares beſpeak this ordinance of preaching fooliſhneſſe indeed. But Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> (I feare) hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven much occaſion to the world to think, that he eſteems it but a light thing to proſtitute the authority, neceſſity, weight of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the credit of his own opinion.</p>

               <hi>Thoſe things that have no cognation or kinred with, or relation at all to a Saviour and Mediator, cannot by their owne natural import diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Chriſt, or life upon repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the raine and fruitful ſeaſons have no natural kinred to Chriſt as Mediator, or any relation to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore they cannot by their natural import preach Chriſt, or be ſufficient meanes of faith in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The propoſition of this argument is thus ſtrengthned; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can naturally and rationally diſcover any thing that is not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and rationally contained in it, that by a rational reſolution of cauſes and effects into their natural principles, we may be led by the one to the other in a rational proceſſe.</p>
            <p>But there is no ſuch natural relation or kindred betwixt the raine and fruitful ſeaſons and Chriſt. Thus I prove it.</p>
            <q>Thoſe things that in a courſe of providence had their ends and uſes, and were to have their beings, although Adam had never ſinned, and ſo there had been no place for ſuch a perſon as Chriſt; have no natural relation to Chriſt, neither can naturally import him.</q>
            <p>But the former is true of rain and fruitful ſeaſons.</p>
            <p>Therefore the latter is true of them alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> was ſet to till the ground, and after the firſt creation,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.5</note> the fruits of the earth were to be propagated by the help of the influences of heaven as well as mans induſtry, as appeareth by the text; A miſt went up from the earth to water the face of the ground. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.6. True it is, they are continued to us by vertue of the merits of Chriſt, but this is not natural and from their firſt original. Fruitful ſeaſons are not peculiar to man as fallen, nor yet to man reſtored; but were alſo in common with <hi>Adam</hi> ſtanding: Now I demand whether rain or fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeaſons had diſcovered ſuch a perſon as Chriſt? Such a work as ſatisfaction, life upon ſuch a condition as repentance, in his integrity, in which condition I know <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> will ſay, he was not capable either of the work or diſcovery of a Mediatour. If they did not, then, I demand what alteration is there in their faces now? or how can men make a rational deduction of Chriſt from them now, more then in his integrity? I ſay, by their own natural import, without the help of further meanes to acquaint us with all the tranſactions betwixt God and fallen man.</p>
            <p>Thus I have by a few arguments labour'd to prove that raine &amp; fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeaſons do not, cannot preach Chriſt, diſcover life upon repentance; and by theſe I conceive I have refelled his firſt reaſon wherby he would prove that the Apoſtle in <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16. affirmes that God by thoſe fruitful ſeaſons did not leave himſelfe without witneſſe of his good
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118748:35"/>
affection in Jeſus Chriſt to the world. His reaſon is, becauſe ſuch things as ſhowres and fruitful ſeaſons are fit and proper onely to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie Chriſt and mercy in him.</p>
            <p>His ſecond reaſon by which he would prove that the raine and fruitful ſeaſons <hi>Act.</hi> 14.16 preach Chriſt and the goſpel, and the good will of God to men in Chriſt Jeſus, is this as followeth:</p>
            <p>[<q>The Apoſtle being to preach the goſpel unto the Gentiles, preached no other doctrine to them at <hi>Lyſtra</hi> but this; we cannot think that hee preached only metaphyſical and philoſophical ſermons concerning the eſſence and properties of God, but that which was evangelical and ſavouring of the goſpel. Now the holy Ghoſt reporteth nothing evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, if this be not.] But this reaſon diſcovers as much of Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> as any that went before, For,</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Take notice how he doth ſecretly aſperſe the Theological and divine Sermons of the Apoſtle, concerning the eſſence, and properties, and providence of God, with the detracting titles of metaphyſical and philoſophical Sermons. Will not Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> knowledge ſerve him to diſcerne a difference betwixt Theology and Philoſophy? God being <hi>ſupra omnes Ens,</hi> and <hi>extra omne praedicamentum,</hi> above all Entities, and without all praedicaments. The diſcourſes of his nature, eſſence, and properties, are very weakly and abſurdly called metaphyſical, which conſiders <hi>ens, quatenus ens,</hi> for its object; Metaphiſicks conſider God no otherwiſe then it conſiders all other beings, as <hi>unum, bonum &amp; verum,</hi> that is, as having onely an entitive unity, goodneſſe and truth: but to conſider God as a Creatour and Preſerver; as the fountaine of all good, theſe are above metaphyſical notions and Sermons. Hence it is a rule, <hi>Metaphyſica parit ſcientiam tantum, ſed Theologia fidem,</hi> that is, Metaphyſicks beget a knowledge onely, but Theology or Divinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth faith. I would adviſe Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to retract theſe notions, leſt his Church, who are much led by an implicite faith, ſhould think that the divine diſcoveries of Gods nature, and properties, and providence, comes under the notion of vaine philoſophy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe they were metaphyſical Sermons truly ſo called, yet in the next place Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſuppoſeth that the Apoſtle muſt not preach ſuch, he being to preach the Goſpel at <hi>Lyſtra;</hi> as if the preaching of the goſpel, and the precahing of the nature, eſſence, and proprieties of God, were not conſiſtent: But upon what colour of reaſon, I pray you? may not ſuch diſcoveries diſpoſe and prepare them to receive the moſt intimate concluſions of the goſpel? Nay, are not ſuch diſcoveries ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to this believing in Chriſt? and are not ſuch preparations and diſpoſitions to receive the goſpel, the foundation of this doctrine of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal grace, which the Remonſtrants ſo much contend for? True indeed, had the Apoſtle come to preach the goſpel to the Jewes, who were well inſtructed in the knowledge of the true God, there had been no ſuch neceſſity; but coming to the Gentiles, who were generally lead away to dumb idols, as the Apoſtle teſtifieth, and did not know the true God; it is now requiſite that he begin here to make them to know
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118748:35"/>
him. For the ſaving knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt doth ſuppoſe a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening knowledge of the true God, as in <hi>Jo.</hi> 17.3.<note place="margin">John 17.3</note> 
               <hi>it is life eternal to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> And in that text ſo much uſed in vaine by Mr. <hi>Goodwin, Heb.</hi> 11.6.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6</note> 
               <hi>he that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to God muſt firſt believe that God is.</hi> But let Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether thoſe diſcourſes which treat of the nature, eſſence, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of God, be not pertinent notions to make men believe that God is; and that is no more then we muſt conclude, if our underſtandings doe but goe hand in hand with the Scriptures: for to believe in Chriſt, is no more then to believe that God is reconciled to us in Chriſt, Gods juſtice ſatisfied in Chriſt, and that God will bleſſe us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt, which naturally importeth that there is a God, who is reconciled, whoſe juſtice is ſatisfied, who was offended, and who is a rewarder of them that ſeek him. Hence Divines will tell him, that Chriſt is but <hi>objectum mediatum et ſecundarium fidei,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ameſ. med. Theol. pag. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note> the mediate and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary object of ſaving faith, and God himſelfe the primary object of faith, as the Apoſtle telleth us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>we believe by him, in God that rayſed him from the dead.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. This truſt have wee in God through Chriſt; ſo that it appeares to me in vaine to preach Chriſt by whom attonement is made, before we teach the true God, who is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and therefore ſtand in need of having an attonement made; and alſo, that theſe ſermons of the nature, properties, and eſſence of God are neceſſary to the diſcoverie of Chriſt, and may reductively and <hi>diſpoſitive</hi> be called the preaching of the goſpel. Why then ſhould Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> thus weakly argue, that the Apoſtle did not preach the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and eſſence of God, becauſe his task was to preach the goſpel? The Argument would avail <hi>è contra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſe I grant him theſe, yet he will be found too light in the ballance, for he ſaith, <hi>that this muſt needs be goſpel, becauſe if this be not goſpel, he is not found to preach the goſpel at all at Lyſtra, the holy Ghoſt doth not diſcover to us any other goſpel preach't at Lyſtra.</hi> I know not how to blemiſh his underſtanding ſo much, as to ſay he cannot diſcover ſo much in the text as may confute him; neither would I be cenſorious as to judge him too too willing to deceive both himſelfe and his reader: but I leave it to the world to judge. He cannot but know there were many intervening degrees betwixt theſe words of the Apoſtle, and the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which he preached at <hi>Lyſtra.</hi> Theſe words in controverſie were ſpoken upon the occaſion of the peoples idolatry; this idolatry was upon the occaſion of Apoſtles healing the criple: and this miracle was occaſioned by the Apoſtles ſeeing that the criple had faith to be healed, and that faith was wrought by the goſpel which the Apoſtle preached, as the text expreſſely ſaith, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. by which he converted ſome to the faith, although others were yet given to idolatry. Now put the caſe that the words in queſtion be not the goſpel; yet may we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſay that they preached the goſpel at <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> becauſe the holy Ghoſt ſaith that they did preach the goſpel there, and therefore that which he produceth as a reaſon, ſeemes to be of the ſame validity with
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118748:36"/>
all the reſt, which is this; <hi>the Apoſtles preached no other goſpel, becauſe it is not recorded.</hi> And may we not ſay by the ſame rule in <hi>ver.</hi> 20.21. that <hi>Paul</hi> preached no goſpel at <hi>Derbe,</hi> becauſe what <hi>Paul</hi> preached there, is not recorded? and would not this reaſoning help us to give the holy Ghoſt the lye? who ſaith in both, that they preached the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel both at <hi>Dorbe,</hi> and at <hi>Lyſtra.</hi> By this time any rational man may ſee what is become of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> double <hi>doubtleſſe,</hi> and I cannot but profeſſe it a tedious task to be tyed to trace him through all his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances, and impertinent allegations. And it is ſtrange to me that he that undertakes to produce ſuch arguments that neither men on earth, nor angels in heaven, can anſwer, as he ſaith of himſelf in his diſpute with <hi>Mr. Simpſon,</hi> I need not cite the page, it is ſo notorious: that he (I ſay) ſhould thus delitate in a matter of ſo great concernement, and that not one allegation, nor any particular in any Allegation ſhould have the leaſt concluſive validity in it, Certainely muſt produce ſome more weighty reaſons to prove that the raine and fruitfull ſeaſons are fit teſtimonies of a Saviour and attonement by him, and the ſumme of the Goſpel, otherwiſe he is not of that credit with me as to take his bare word for it, and he hath no reaſon to faſten any blame upon us for not believing his aſſertions herein, becauſe wee finde him declining his own heights very much; for after all theſe his impertinent notions we find him giving the ſum of all that went before in this impertinent concluſion, thus; <hi>ſo that it is cleare from this Scripture, that all the world, even thoſe that are moſt ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſcanted in this kind, thoſe that have not the letter of the goſpel, have yet the ſufficient meanes of believing,</hi> 1. <hi>That God is.</hi> 2. <hi>That he is a rewarder of all that ſeek him,</hi> Heb. 11.6. <hi>which the Apoſtle makes to be all the faith abſolutely neceſſary to bring us into favour with him.</hi> How is he ſuddenly ſunk into a degenerous concluſion, that do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>not at all ſuit with his intended purpoſe, which was to prove that all heathen men are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently enabled to believe in Chriſt, and to draw out the ſum and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the goſpel? and he proves it by a text which he ſaith proves no more, then that men may believe, Firſt, that God is. Secondly, that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him. Is not <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> able to ſee a wide diſtance betwixt theſe two, to believe on Chriſt, and to believe that God is? Although every one that believes in Chriſt muſt believe in God, yet it followeth not <hi>è contra,</hi> that all thoſe that believe that God is,<note place="margin">Secundum et primò ſuccedaneu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praeceptum eſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei in Chriſtum non generalis il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius fideiqae ante ipſum oenitentiae actum, et quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet legalem o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bedientiam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiritur, quâ credimus Deum eſſe, et praem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity did believe that God was, and that he was a rewarder of them that ſeek him; but I hope <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> will ſay, that to believe in Jeſus Chriſt is no act proper and ſuitable for the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Adams</hi> integrity, therefore he had neither a ſufficiency, nor yet an obligation to believe, Again, the Jewes under the old Teſtament did believe that God was, and that he was a rewarder of all them that ſeek him, as is expreſſed <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. But <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for this, that they did not believe expreſſely in Chriſt, and it is a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118748:36"/>
pillar of the <hi>Arminian</hi> doctrine, that faith in Jeſus Chriſt was neither obſerved nor yet commanded. To believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, is a general faith that is requiſite to every legal obedience, even there where Chriſt hath no place or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> one of the prolocutors of his ſide clearely ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. Nay, yet further, let <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> conſider whether the devils in hell doe not believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder as well of them that ſeek him, as of them that diſobey him; but theſe are neither in a ſufficiency or obligation, nor yet in a capacity of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Chriſt; the faith of the former comes far ſhort of the faith in the latter. Although Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is pleaſed to ſay in a ſecond place, thus; <hi>Which the Apoſtle makes to be all the faith abſolutely neceſſary to bring men into favour with him.</hi> But what ground in the text doth hee diſcerne for this his aſſertion? the text ſaith indeed that <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> himſelfe, that an evangelical faith is faith in Chriſt; and the text further ſaith, that he that cometh to God, muſt firſt believe that God is; but it doth not ſay that believing that God is, is all that is neceſſary to believing in Chriſt, or bringing men into favour with him; he that ſaith, he that aſcendeth to the top of the ladder muſt climbe up the firſt ſtep, doth not ſay, that to climbe up the firſt ſtep is ſufficient, and onely neceſſary to the reaching to the top of the ladder. It may helpe to illuſtrate the caſe in hand.</p>
            <p>And if Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> will have no more as probable from this text in <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16. then this, that the raine and fruitful ſeaſons are meanes ſufficient of knowing and believing that God is, and that he is a rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them that ſeek him, he ſhal quietly reſt with his deſire, although it be a <hi>non probatum.</hi> But then I muſt admoniſh him, that if no more can be forced from this text, not to put any more the word of God upon the rack to ſtretch it to his owne heights, to make it ſpeak thus much, <hi>that raine and fruitfull ſeaſons are ſufficient meanes to bring men to faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and to draw out the ſumme of the goſpel.</hi> And how imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent this text is to prove his aſſertion, let all the world judge, ſeeing it doth not ariſe ſo high as faith in Jeſus Chriſt, or the ſumme of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but onely thus far by his owne confeſſion, that God is, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The third text by which he proveth his aſſertion, is from <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.4.</note> 
               <hi>Not knowing that the patience of God leadeth thee to repentance,</hi> which he urgeth thus; <hi>that the patience of God leadeth thee to repentance, becauſe it doth by way of a rational progreſſe, and cleare interpretation diſcover a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to receive ſuch unto grace and favour who repent unfeinedly.</hi> The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of which reaſon looks upon us with the ſame face of diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with all that went before. Suppoſe I grant all; yet how will <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> prove that it is either called patience and longſuffering, however knowne by that name, without the advantage of the written word, wherein are contained admonitions to repent, and ſo ſayd to lead to repentance? and this he muſt prove before he ſhall carry the cauſe by the force of this text To decide this difficulty, let us conſider, firſt, the ſcope of the Apoſtle in the former part of this Epiſtle, <hi>viz.</hi>

A heart that <hi>cannot repent,</hi> God never layeth it to the charge of any man until he hath uſed all means to bring men to repentance, which he is never ſaid to do until he give them his word to admoniſh them to repent. It is true indeed, they may <hi>be non punjtentes,</hi> but not <hi>impoenitentes,</hi> that is negative, but not

privative impenitents. Men are not ſaid to be incapable of being renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by repentance before they have had a taſte of the good word of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5, 6. And true it is, that the wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all unrighteouſneſſe; and they that ſin without law, ſhall periſh without law; but to <hi>treaſure up wrath,</hi> to be veſſels of wrath fitted for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in whom wrath is treaſured up, which is all one with the finding the day of judgment more intollerable then <hi>Sodom,</hi> I know the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants themſelves wil not admit without the word.

               <hi>How can it be that they ſhould repent, or be ſaid to have repented? if miracles be conſidered only as miracles without the word, miracles cannot perſwade to repentance; it is neceſſary that the word be added, by which repentance is commanded, or at leaſt men invited to it, for without the word men cannot put forth ſo much as a feigned repentance.</hi> And the judgement of the beſt of his own ſide will bee a good argument againſt him; for if miracles and the works of extraordinary providence cannot lead to repentance without the word, how then can the works of common providence do it without the word? Now if this text and all the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in it do import a mixture of the word with all the lenity and forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God, then any man may ſee how impertinently it is produced as a proof for his aſſertion, which is, that the heathen are bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe in Chriſt, even thoſe that never had the word or letter of the goſpel. And thus we have taken a ſurvey of his clear Scriptures, which he ſaith he hath well examined, and alſo of the concluſive validity of them for his purpoſe. Having diſcovered all his ſtrength in divine teſtimonies, he makes a tranſiſion to humane, pretending to the world, he hath both God &amp; man on his ſide, but as he doth with the one; ſo he doth with the other, abuſeth them both ſufficiently. As he produceth a threefold divine, ſo he produceth a threefold humane teſtimony in the fourteenth page of this book, the one is out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> the ſecond out of <hi>Muſculus,</hi> the third out of the Britiſh divines in the Synod of <hi>Dort:</hi> but by what colour he calleth them to the favour of this cauſe, I am not able to divine: the dint of their teſtimony lyeth in this, <hi>that he calleth on all men to repent and believe in Chriſt without exception.</hi> B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t had he either diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or conſidered what call they mean, I perſwade my ſelfe he would have waved their teſtimony. He would make us believe that they affirm that God calls all to repentance by ſuch a call as is without the letter of the goſpel: otherwiſe what is their teſtimony to his cauſe? But in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is guilty of manifeſt ſubornation, for as for <hi>Calvin,</hi> he witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth no ſuch thing, and that I cleare thus;</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is ſo far from teſtifying to <hi>Mr Goodwins</hi> aſſertion, that he ſaith that no man is ſufficiently enabled to the knowledge of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour without the familiar ducture of the Scriptures; it is the adequate ſubject of the ſixt chapter of the firſt book of his Inſtitutions; and if he ſay that man cannot come to the ſaving knowledge of his creator with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of the written word, we cannot rationally conceive that he whom Mr, <hi>Goodwin</hi> calleth one of the beſt of the Proteſtant Divines,

               </gap>ct is, as followeth, <hi>that man can ſo uſe the common grace, (the light of nature) that by it he may receive evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical grace; and that God hath for his part ſhewne himſelfe ready to reveale Chriſt to all men, ſeeing he doth ſufficiently afford to every man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary meanes for the making of Chriſt knowne, and for faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Now if they reject that as an errour, which is the adequate ſubject of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> aſſertion, certainely theſe are no probable or likely men to add any ſtrength to his cauſe; and I expect in his next that he produce the words and place where any of theſe men ſpeake of a faith grounded onely upon the ſound of the heavens, or that the heathen are enabled by the light of nature to believe in Chriſt; or elſe to judge himſelfe whether it be not an unchriſtian courſe to force ſuch a ſenſe of mens writings contrary to the ſtreſſe and current of their judgement, that ſo he may have the more plauſible way for his cauſeleſs calumny of inconſiſtencies and contradictions; and when he hath ſo barbarouſly broken their heads, ſo childiſhly to give them a plaiſter, by anking them in the number of the beſt Proteſtant Divines,

            <p>Thus have I examined all his proofes both divine and humane, and I cannot but adjudg them far ſhort of proving his tenent; and therfore I adviſe him either to ſend out new, or to take a review of theſe in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and better examination, for they are all impertinent to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion firſt propounded; ſome of them neceſſarily inferring the letter of the goſpel, the reſt not inferring at all either repentance or faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, therefore no proper teſtimony for this doctrine, that all men without exception are bound to believe in Chriſt, though they never heard the letter of the goſpel And thus I have indeavoured to ſatisfie his owne deſires, and have taken the weapons out of his hands,<note place="margin">

for the truth, I am ſorry; for him, but as he is a ſcholler, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all as a man of eminent parts, I am aſhamed of him, that the world ſhould ſee ſuch pregnant ſymptomes of an impoſture upon him; that when he is forced to ſay that no man hath an immediate ſufficiency originally given him of God to believe, he ſhould now ſay, that he only ſuppoſeth for arguments ſake, that the heathen have not an immediate capacity of believing.

This Argument I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive hath ſo much weight in it, that it will deſervedly challenge their moſt intimate conſideration, and it is grounded upon this foundation: For God to ſuffer them to walk in their own waies, which the word of God affirmeth, and yet to do what in him lieth to hinder them from ſo doing, which this method of the Remonſtrants muſt needs import, are in themſelves very contradictious and inconſiſtent, and that upon the principle of <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelf, which is, that <note n="(a)" place="margin">Permiſſio eſt ceſſat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Will they think it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional for us to ſay, that that father which gives to his ſon a great eſtate, or it may be a leſſer portion, to negotiate and trade with, and alſo by his counſel and direction, yea and his labour and pains, is ready to aſſiſt him; that he ſhould be ſaid to leave him to himſelf, and to ſuffer him to walk in his own waies? So in this caſe, they ſay that God gives all the heathen a law to circumſcribe them, and by that their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will accuſe them, and condemn them if they walk not according to that law, and this <hi>God</hi> gives them as a full ſtock and meaſure of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, to negotiate and drive on an heavenly trade, and with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that they may thrive in a ſpiritual eſtate towards heaven; and not onely ſo, but by the motion of his holy Spirit, aſſiſt, direct, and move, and perſwade to reſtrain them from abuſing thoſe Talents, and to the end they may uſe them well. If ſo, then what truth can there be in that Scripture, that ſaith, God ſuffered them to walk in their evill waies? or if there be truth in thoſe Scriptures, what truth then in thoſe frequent aſſertions of theirs, that contein ſuch adminiſtrations of grace to them, to hinder them from walking in their own waies? ſeeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion and impedition cannot ſtand together; no nor your permiſſion and the putting forth ſuch means, as either they ſuppoſe may, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſhould hinder ſuch actions, can conſiſt and ſtand together.</p>

            <p>We challenge (and that but in equity) that liberty of arguing which they take unto themſelves: When we urge that <hi>Adam</hi> in integrity had that grace, which if we had now unmaimed and not impaired, we might be as able to beleeve in Chriſt, as <hi>Adam</hi> was to do that which was commanded him; and ſo by conſequence that grace which <hi>Adam</hi> had was <hi>(principium poteſtativum credendi in Chriſtum)</hi> the poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive principle of beleeving in Chriſt, if his condition had required it. To this they ſay, <hi>God did not give ſuch power to beleeve to</hi> Adam <hi>in his integrity, becauſe then there was no need of it:</hi> and that upon this ground, it is againſt the wiſdom of the Almighty to give grace to do that, of which there is no need, or to give grace where there is no need And may not we likewiſe ſay, that it is not ſuitable to the wiſedome of God, to give his ſpecial aſſiſting grace to enable them to uſe the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture well, when they are enabled without that grace to do the things conteined in the Law? Now in this Argument I ſhall proceed onely upon their principles, and I clear it thus.

               <hi>In ſpiritual death, ſpiritual gifts are not properly ſeparated from the will, becauſe they were never in it; for in the will there is onely that liberty of doing good or evil, which liberty although it cannot put forth its ſtrength in fallen man becauſe of the blindneſſe of his underſtanding, and depravation of his affections, yet it remaineth as part of a created nature.</hi> And many of ſuch like expreſsions paſſe in that argument, by all which they affirm death to be onely in the underſtanding and affections, not in the will; but that in the depth of ſpiritual death, the will according to its natural freedome, can act as the underſtanding dictateth, and the affections move; all which are very contradictious to themſelves in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, and the holy Scriptures every where: yet upon this ground I proceed againſt them with their own ſword, The will needs no life to be infuſed anew, it is enough if the underſtanding and the affections be rectified; but as for the underſtanding that hath the knowledge of God, and the truth naturally, which <hi>Arminius</hi> calleth <hi>(Lumen naturale)</hi> natural light, and <hi>Corvinus Scinitilla luminis,</hi> ſparks of light, which light is called the law of Nature, and ſo often by the Arminians and <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> called natural light: and in the affections there is a deſire of good, fighting with inordinate deſires, and by both they come to do the things conteined in the Law, and that by nature; what need then of a principle of aſsiſting grace conferred anew, to enable them to do any of theſe? True indeed, the Remonſtrants often uſe the word grace as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius</hi> did,<note place="margin">Gratiae vocabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo invidiam fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens, &amp; offenſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem declinans.</note> of whom it was ſaid (by the word <hi>grace</hi> he indeavoured to break the cloud of envy, and avoid offences) ſo theſe, meerly to ſerve them at this turn, and to carry on their own intereſt, are ſtrong ſticklers for the grace of God, to aſsiſt man in doing the leaſt thing towards grace and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>When they would prove man not to be wholly dead, they urge ſome Reliques of life, whereby he is able to know God, deſire good, fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his luſts, govern his locomotion, do the things conteined in the Law,<note place="margin">Textus non dicit eos diſpoſitos eſſe à Deo. <hi>Coll. Hag.</hi> 109.</note> and ſo to diſpoſe themſelves to grace and eternal life: for thus they ſay when they ſpeak of, or rather pervert that text, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>(As many as were ordained to eternal life beleeved)</hi> they ſay that <hi>(or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained)</hi> in the text, is no more then diſpoſed to eternal life; and that the text ſaith not they are diſpoſed by God to eternal life. Now not to be diſpoſed by God, is not to be diſpoſed by the grace of God; for by that we ſay men are diſpoſed to eternal life: but it ſeemeth they ſay men are diſpoſed to eternal life, and yet not by God or his grace, and what
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118748:43"/>
can this be but by nature, and the natural powers of man, and ſo of themſelves without any new principle of aſſiſting grace? And yet when they come to make out a general and univerſal grace, then no man muſt be diſpoſed to do any thing, or know any thing, but by a principle of aſsiſting grace, without which, nature is wholly blind; and are now become as abſolute patrons of the grace of God as may bee. Oh the fraud and jugling of theſe ſupporters of the doctrine of univerſal grace! I urge theſe two things to them; Firſt, when they urge that man by the relicks of life hath abilities to all thoſe things before mentioned, and this to prove man not to be wholly dead. I demand whether they underſtand man to have thoſe abilities by the reliques of life, with the aſsiſting grace of God or without it: if they meane with it; then it is very impertinent to prove man not to be wholly dead; for no man is ſo ſimple to plead man to be ſo dead by ſinne, that hee cannot do anything, being excited and aſsiſted by the grace of God; and if they meane the reliques of life without that grace, then I have what I deſire, that all men have not grace; ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal grace falleth. Secondly, I urge, if thoſe words in <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which text according to their own gloſſe is to be read thus [as many as were diſpoſed to eternal life;] if thoſe words (I ſay) <hi>diſpoſed to eternal life,</hi> doe not neceſſarily import thus much, that men are diſpoſed by God to eternal life; Then what ground have they to ſay that no man is able to do the things contained in the law, or any thing whereby hee is diſpoſed to faith and regeneration, but as he is aſsiſted by the grace of God <hi>de novo?</hi> How neceſſarily is this doctrine inevitably involved? When they would prove man not to be wholly dead, then we have it only thus, [they do by nature the things contained in the law;] but when they come to prove univerſal grace, we have it with a comment thus; [they do the things contained in the law by nature, as it is helped and aſsiſted by grace] let them adhere either to the one or other: either, that man hath no ſuch reliques of life by which he is able to diſpoſe himſelfe to faith; or elſe that a new principle of aſsiſting grace is not needful, nor gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to every man. The one wil help in the point of the manner of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods grace in mans converſion; the other in the point of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal grace. And until they can reconcile thoſe reliques of life in every man, wherby they are enabled to do thoſe things contained in the law, &amp; to prepare themſelvs for faith; and the neceſsity of the aſsiſting principle of Gods grace to be imparted to man anew, for thoſe ends &amp; purpoſes; I ſhal conclude, that they do but uſurp the name &amp; title of univerſal grace.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to prove that that which they pretend is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to everie man, cannot be called Grace. In the next place I ſhal exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether that which is given to every man (although it be granted to be grace) be truly ſaid to be ſufficient. Now this muſt be proved as wel as the former, if they wil carry up to the height an univerſal ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grace.</p>
            <p>Now that this buſineſs may be perſpicuouſly decided, it is requiſite that we firſt conſider the nature and definition of ſufficiencie, in general, and then apply it to particular caſes.</p>

               <hi>So much as appertaineth to the heathen to whom the name of Chriſt never came, wee have oftentimes ſaid that they are not endued with a grace ſufficient, abſolutely, either to faith or regeneration; therfore wee have put divers degrees and meaſures of ſufficiency, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their call.</hi> So that we have clearly diſcovered negatively, what the general and common grace is not ſufficient to effect, namely not ſufficient to ſalvation, not yet to faith in Chriſt: but affirmatively, to what it is ſufficient, ſomething more dubiouſly. Sometimes we have it thus, <hi>It is ſufficient to thoſe actions by which men are diſpoſed to faith and regeneration.</hi> Other ſometimes we have it thus, <hi>that by it men may be diſpoſed to become apt and fit hearers of the Goſpel,</hi> as the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants in a forementioned place: which muſt be things very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.

               <hi>A man that is dead in ſinnes, hath the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in his underſtanding, the deſire of that knowne good in his affections, by which he can doe the things contained in the Law, fight and ſtrive with his deſires, governe his locomotion; all which are required of thoſe whom God willeth to regenerate.</hi> So that by theſe wee may gather up a catalogue of thoſe actions to which man hath ſufficient meanes, and by which he is diſpoſed to faith and regeneration; namely, knowledge of God, deſires after God and ſaving grace, groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burthen of ſinne, fighting with inordinate deſires, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the locomotion. Theſe and ſuch like are thoſe actions they mean of. Now I muſt examine theſe two things. Firſt, whether theſe actions bee diſpoſitive to regeneration, or that men be therby properly ſaid to be prepared to converſion. Secondly, whether (though this be gran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted) all men may be truly ſaid to be ſufficiently enabled for ſuch actions.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, I urge two wayes. Firſt to examine whether theſe actions be truly ſaid to be the effects of regeneration, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to it. It is the grand queſtion betwixt <hi>Molincus</hi> and <hi>Corvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. Molineus</hi> affirmes them to be effects; <hi>Corvinus</hi> contends for this, that they are but preparations to it, and may be where converſion is not. I ſhall not uſe any elaborate diſcourſe in this buſineſſe, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to put them, or any for them to conſider, whether to grieve for ſin, and groan under the burthen of ſinne, and to fight with inordinate luſts and deſires, and from thoſe to deſire and thirſt after the ſaving grace of God, bee not parts of converſion: Is there not a change in the affections when we deſire good, and the ſaving grace of God, and are ſo farre eſtranged from ſin, as to groan under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of them; and from that change in affections wee come to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt inordinate deſires? which phraſe intimateth a reluctance, or aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in the mind from ſin, contrary to that condition wherin our minds are ſet upon evil works; <hi>Col.</hi> 1. In converſion there is a double terme, <hi>A quo,</hi> and <hi>Ad quem,</hi> from which, to which we are converted; in theſe actions there is both from ſin, to God and his grace, and that both in deſires, affections, and execution: and is it not yet converſion with the Remonſtrants? We may wonder by what colour of reaſon they can imagine,<note place="margin">In Actis dicitur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it wil be an excellent proofe, when they prove that theſe mentioned in theſe Scriptures were not converted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118748:45"/>
the preaching of the Apoſtles, which I believe wil be <hi>ad Gracas Calendas,</hi> Let any <hi>Arminian</hi> tell me what one ſyllable in thoſe texts, import that thoſe there ſpoken of, were then unconverted: or where do we find any footſteps of their converſion afterwards, or that the Apoſtle was ſent for to convert <hi>Cornelius;</hi> and where hee did it? til this be done, I ſhall conclude their proofe very infirm and weake. For the Apoſtle did not goe to <hi>Cornelius</hi> to convert him to God, but to inſtruct him in a more particular and diſtinct knowledge of Chriſt; which I hope they will grant many had not in thoſe daies, and before that yet were converted to God.</p>
            <p>A ſecond piece of their reaſon, wee have from the ſame Author, and in the ſame place, from this, that the feare of God is ſaid to be before the revelation of the divine wills and his Argument is this; <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ille timor convenit nondum credentibus, qui praecedit revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem divinae voluntatis; talis eſt timor de quo ſermo eſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.12, 14. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That fear agreeth well to thoſe that yet believe not in Chriſt, which goeth before the revelation of the divine will: But ſuch a feare is that ſpoken of, Pſal.</hi> 25.12, 14. <hi>Ergo.</hi> But when this argument is reduced to a right and legitimate formation, it wil appear to be of the ſame ſize with the former.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for that phraſe, <hi>believeth not in Chriſt,</hi> he ſhould have inſerted, <hi>are not converted;</hi> now it is ill confounding theſe two, becauſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, many before Chriſt (of whom this text is ſpoken) were converted to God, and yet did not believe in Chriſt: ſo that the propoſition ſhould have run thus, [That fear agreeth wel to men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, which goeth before the revelation of Gods wil.]</p>
            <p>Secondly, That phraſe, <hi>Revelation of the divine will,</hi> muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, and we muſt know whether he meaneth, all the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Gods will, or only a further confirmation or increaſe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his wil. If they underſtand it in this laſt ſenſe, I deny the Propoſition; if in the former, the Aſſumption: for the fear there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of doth not precede all knowledg of the divine will. God may well be ſaid to ſhew his covenant, and to teach in the way that he ſhall chuſe, and to tell his ſecrets to them that are already converted, and have had ſome diſcoveries of his will; otherwiſe <hi>David</hi> ſo often as hee prayes to God in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. to teach him his word, his wil, his waies, his ſtatutes, ſo often he ſhould beſpeake himſelf without the knowledge of Gods will, and yet unconverted. And by ſuch arguments as thoſe they attempt to prove that thoſe actions are but preparative to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and regeneration. I ſhall only come againſt them with their own ſword in one Argument, thus: they grant us in expreſſe terms, that <note n="(b)" place="margin">Homo in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu peccati nihil boni ex ſe &amp; à ſe poteſt aut facere aut velle, aut cogitare; ſed ne ceſſe eſt ut in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectu, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, affectibus, &amp; omnibus viri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus renovetur. <hi>Script.

Who ever yet feigned to himſelf man ſo deſtitute of power that he could do nothing? But with him it ſeems man hath ſuch a ſufficiency of grace, that he can do ſomething.

The members thereof are coincident, and ſo no legitimate members of a diſtinction; and alſo the laſt member, which he granteth, ſerveth our turne; for then thoſe actions which they produce, which all men have ſufficient grace to performe, (as they ſay) are by <hi>Corvinus</hi> his owne confeſſion ſuch as have the ſubſtance of good, and are not feignedly but truly good: then how can ſuch things be done before regeneration as pre-diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therunto, ſeeing they are truly good? and becauſe they are ſo, according to their own conceſſions, they cannot be done by any man untill he be regenerated in all his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Our mind is, that man uſing common grace well, is therefore apt and fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, becauſe God doth reveale the Goſpel to ſuch with fruit, and doth worke faith in ſuch.</hi> And in another place ſpeaking of theſe verie actions, ſaith thus, <hi>God requireth them of him whom he wil rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</hi> And many more to this purpoſe; whereby they in ſtead of proofe from Scriptures, being deductions of their owne, which are very obnoxious to ſcruple; and their reaſoning is this, they deduct mens aptneſſe and fitneſſe to be converted by ſuch acts, from Gods diſpenſations, and his actual converting of thoſe in whom are ſeen thoſe acts.

There are no ſuch congruities in men, or diſpoſitions to determine the will of God to give them converting grace, but according to their owne judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he uſeth ſuch a liberty, that as <hi>Jacob,</hi> he layeth his right hand upon the youngeſt ſon, and reſerves his left for his eldeſt, which makes us oftentimes to admire the depth of the power and the wiſdom of God.

I anſwer, thus much, that thoſe actions which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend all may do, are no way diſpoſitions to converting grace or rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and therefore they have no colour of reaſon to pretend men are ſufficiently enabled to do them, and that in reference to ſalvation; making all to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Wee hold no habitual grace common to all, but only the aſſiſting grace of God to every act, which although it be common to all, as it is prevenient; yet it is but ſpecial as it is adjutant and coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant with them in doing.</hi> In al which I will not inculcate the palpable implications of that accurate Remonſtrant; whereby hee muſt grant the ſame grace both common to all, and yet ſpecial to ſome; common to all becauſe ſufficient, and yet ſpecial, becauſe aſſiſting: Wee muſt note alſo, that aſſiſting grace is <hi>(in agendo)</hi> in doing. Sufficient is <hi>(ad agendum)</hi> to the doing any act; and <hi>(adjuvant)</hi> and <hi>(Cooperant)</hi> and <hi>(aſſiſtant)</hi> I take to be termes equipollent. Therfore to let the mplication die, by the helpe of theſe two places of <hi>Corvinus,</hi> I thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, which wil bring mee to a fair iſſue in this point. My Argument this.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:118748:47"/>
               <p>If all men have not the aſsiſting grace of God to do all thoſe actions, then they have not a ſufficient grace.</p>
               <p>But all men have not the aſſiſtant grace of God, to and in thoſe actions. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Not ſufficient grace.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Propoſition of this ſyllogiſm is grounded upon <hi>Corvinus</hi> his firſt expreſſion. <hi>What-ever wee ſpeak of ſufficiency, we aſcribe it to the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gods Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The minor propoſition is grounded upon his ſecond, <hi>Which grace is common to all, as it is prevenient; but ſpecial as it is adjuvant and coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, which are all one with aſſiſtant.</hi> But I further prove the minor thus: <q>
                  <l>If all men do not actually do thoſe actions, then all men have not the aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting grace of God.</l>
                  <l>But all men do not, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Therefore they have not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Propoſition of this argument is grounded upon this truth, The aſſiſting ſpirit of God is only had in doing; God then aſſiſts, and helpes, and cooperateth, when wee actually doe: aſſiſting is properly only in doing. Improperly <hi>(ad agendum)</hi> to the doing.</p>
            <p>The minor is clear by experience, and many Scriptures. Now I have waded ſo farre in this Argument, becauſe it ſo fairly leads mee to a buſineſſe of very great concernment, touching the nature of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency; and that is, whether any thing can be truly ſaid to be ſufficient to the working of any good in man, but what is efficient. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wee are ſo fairly led by the hand of their owne conceſſion, I ſhall aſſume that liberty at this time to deny it, and to ſay, that no grace is ſufficient to converſion, or to work any good but what is efficient, and doth actually work it. And to prove it, I ſhall in the firſt place make uſe of their definition of ſufficiency in general; which was, that it is a poſition of all things that are requiſite and neceſſary to that action to which a ſufficiencie is granted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I muſt alſo adapt the Queſtion to the particular ſtate and condition of man, as he is now corrupt and fallen; and by reaſon of that corruption many impediments and hinderances lie in the way to his converſion, or doing any thing that may be called good; which I hope (all will grant) muſt bee removed before hee can bee ſaid to be ſufficiently enabled to be converted, or to do any good; as the woman in the Goſpel could not be ſaid to be ſufficiently enabled to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſepulchre, till the ſtone was rolled away from the doore.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I muſt premiſe alſo, that amongſt other impediments, the depravation and averſation in the wil of man,<note place="margin">

               </note> to convert or doe any good, is one of the main, as Chriſt ſaid to the Jewes, <hi>I would have gathered you, but yee would not:</hi> and againe, <hi>Yee will not come to mee that yee might have life.</hi> And the Apoſtle, <hi>Your minds are ſet upon evil works;</hi> which wil of man hath ſuch a reflexive influence upon the underſtanding, that it is kept off thereby from giving in a true dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and as the Apoſtle ſaith, for the moſt part men are <hi>willingly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant:</hi> and this the Remonſtrants grant, when they ſay, That no man can do any good until the wil be regenerate as well as other facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:118748:47"/>Fourthly, I muſt alſo premiſe this, that when the will is regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and men of unwilling are made willing, (whether it be a phyſicall efficiency of Gods ſpirit, or by moral ſuaſion only) it mattereth nor, then is the grace of God truly ſaid to be efficient; for <hi>velle convertere eſt converti, velle credere eſt credere;</hi> this is my method by which I uſe to prove that there is no ſufficient grace, but that which is efficient; and it is ſo plauſible, that it hath ſome aſſertours beſides my ſelf.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radus Vorſtius</hi> gives his judgment thus, <hi>That ſingular and ſpecial grace by which he indeed makes men juſt, and ſaveth them, is ſo farre efficacious as it not only calls, but alſo excites man drowned in ſinne; ſo alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the event, and of man now vitiated and corrupted, it only can be called ſufficient.</hi> True indeed, I acknowledge there are very elaborate diſputes about this very diſtinction of ſufficient and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace. And the Remonſtrants thus bound either, Sufficient grace they ſay is ſuch as is able to produce the effect; and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient is that which doth actually produce the effect; and this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is good, if taken in the general: but as it is applyed to man in his corrupt eſtate, it will not paſſe; and that upon the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned ground.</p>
            <p>Learned Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> urgeth this alſo, That no grace is ſufficient, but what is efficient, and then proves it; hee firſt aſſerteth it, but <hi>Arminius</hi> he denies it, and maintaineth the diſtinction of ſufficient and efficient grace, and holds that grace may be ſaid to be ſufficient that is not efficient: and he attempts to illuſtrate the buſineſſe thus, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Deus ſufficit multis mundis creandis; ſed ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men efficaciter non fecit: Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus ſufficit ad omnes homines ſalvandos, ſed efficaciter non fecit. <hi>Antiper. p.</hi> 245.</note> 
               <hi>God was ſufficient to have made many worlds, but hee did not make them effectually; Chriſt was ſufficient to ſave all men, but he doth not effect it.</hi> Which Inſtances ſatisfie not for ſeveral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1.) Becauſe there is no due Analogie betwixt creation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in this particular. In creation there are no impediments to hinder this worke; the Chaos riſeth not up againſt the plaſticall power of the Creator; but in man, and that according to their owne principles, there is a ſtrong reſiſting power, and ſo as to make the the work of God altogether null and void, as to the act of converſion; no impediments in the one, but ſuch in the other that can not be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without being efficient.</p>
            <p n="2">2) His arguing is fallacious, for when wee treat of ſufficient means, wee preſuppoſe them to be actually put forth and adminiſtred; and hence the definition of ſufficiency is the Poſition or adhibition of all requiſites; nothing can be ſaid to be ſufficient to produce any act ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be applyed, and put forth. And I may ſay (I ſuppoſe) with a holy reverence, no not the divine power, except it by his holy will be put forth to create; ſo that the divine power may be conſidered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as put forth and ſet on worke by the counſel of his will, or not; if not, then I ſee not (I ſpeak with ſubmiſſion) how it can bee called ſufficient. His omnipotency we are taught thus to conceive of, it is that by which hee doth whatſoever he will; and if that power bee by his wil put forth, it is efficient, and ſo the cauſe returneth to us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:118748:48"/>But Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> doth not only aſſert, but prove alſo, that now in mans corruption nothing is ſufficient to converſion, but what is efficient, and that by an argument which I ſhal follow a little, and it is this,

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This argument is grounded upon this method. Sufficiency imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a poſition of all neceſſaries. Now if all thoſe be neceſſarie, then all muſt concurre to make a ſufficient grace to converſion; and if all concurre, that grace is efficient; then what is more connatural then this, that no grace is ſufficient but what is efficient? And Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> proceeds only upon <hi>Arminius</hi> his owne conceſſions; yet <hi>Arminius</hi> anſwers thus,</p>

               </gap>l concurred could be called ſufficient; and if al did, then it was efficient: and is not the conſequence good? I conceive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable. If all be granted to converſion, before a man can be ſaid to have ſufficient grace to the working of regeneration; then ſufficiency and efficiency muſt needs meet in one; for where all are, there they are certainly efficient; the cooperant grace of God alwaies implying efficiency. But <hi>Arminius</hi> anſwers further, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Omnes illae gratiae, praeveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens nempe et prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parans, aut ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes ſunt, aut ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaces; Deus praevenit ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter &amp; efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, praeparat ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficienter &amp; effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciter, &amp; quaeri poſſit an non ſic de reliquis. <hi>Armin.

               <hi>All thoſe graces, namely, the prevenient, and preparant, are either ſufficient or efficient; God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veneth ſufficiently and effectually, he prepareth ſufficiently and effectually; and it may be enquired into whether it holdeth not in the two laſt graces</hi> But what rational anſwer theſe expreſſes are to the Argument in hand, I am not able to divine, nor the congruity of them with themſelves; The making thoſe graces in one clauſe to be either ſufficient or effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall; in the ſecond clauſe to be both: couplatives and disjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, do not wel in the ſame ſentence, referred to the ſame thing, in the ſame reſpect. Beſides, here is a groſſe miſ-underſtanding of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary: he did not ſay, there was not a ſufficiencie in any of thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alone to their proper ends and actions; as that there was not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie in the prevening grace alone to prevent, ſo not in preparing grace alone to prepare: But he ſaid, not in any alone to convert. If hee underſtand him otherwiſe, he thinks amiſſe: and if he judge of his adverſary aright, his anſwer is very impertinent.</p>
            <p>But further then this, <hi>Arminius</hi> is his owne greateſt enemie. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> contendeth for a ſufficient and efficient grace diſtinct; ſo that he ſhould have produced a ſufficient grace that had not beene effectual, then it had beene to his purpoſe; but this is no probable way to make both ſufficiencie and efficiency to concurre in every grace. And I conceive it is an undeniable argument againſt himſelfe, that if no grace be ſufficient and not efficient, that <hi>(viz.)</hi> God prepareth both ſufficiently and efficiently; and ſo in preventing, operating, coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118748:48"/>
grace; It will appear that no grace is, or can be ſaid to be ſufficient to any end or purpoſe, but what is alſo efficient in the ſame deſigne. And of this I ſhall make a good improvement, to bring to a faire iſſue out of this engagement with them, thus, If no grace, no not ſo much as prevenient and preparant, but they act both ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently and efficiently, and not ſufficiently prepared and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed until they be efficiently ſo; then is my Argument ſtrengthened; which is this, All are not ſufficiently enabled either to convert, or to do thoſe things by which they are diſpoſed to convert, until they do actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do thoſe things which all do not, and therefore are not ſufficiently enabled; and then what becomes of the doctrine of univerſal ſufficient grace? let all the world judg. Thus I have (according to my ſmall ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent) endeavoured to refel the groundleſſe doctrine of univerſal ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grace, and have diſcovered the riſe, and progreſſe, and growth of it, how high it amounteth, where it ſticks, and where the proofe remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on their part very ſhort and imperfect, and that it appeareth not that either all men have that which is truly called grace: or if it might be ſo called, yet they prove not that it may truly be ſaid to be ſufficient to any end, no not to the enabling of men to worke thoſe things by which they ſay men are enabled to converſion; and if neither, then univerſal ſufficient grace muſt needs fall. And by this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Remonſtrants, whom I now leave, I am the better ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to engage Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> notions, which are of a farre lower flight: and to him I now returne after this long digreſſion.</p>

               <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> in his writings, I find excuding a double diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſufficiencie. Firſt, In this place covertly, into <hi>Mediate</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 78, 79.</note> but in other Treatiſes more expreſſe. In his Diſpute with Mr. <hi>Simpſon,</hi> treating about the ſame buſineſſe, hee ſaith thus, <hi>There is a double ſufficiency, mediate and immediate: Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, by which a man is enabled for the doing of ſuch a thing, without the having or doing of any thing elſe but what hee then actually hath or doth. Mediate is ſuch by which he is not enabled to do the thing for the preſent, but he is enabled to do ſuch things by which he may compaſſe farther means, and ſo poſſeſſe himſelf of an immediate capacity.</hi> And this diſtinction hath ſome apparent footſteps in the Remonſtrants. But I conceive, it is no fair and plauſible diſtinction, becauſe the laſt member thereof ſeems to carry a contradiction in the face of it; for, ſaith he, <hi>A me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſufficiency is that whereby a man is not for the preſent enabled to do a thing.</hi> A rare diſcovery! an inſufficient ſufficiencie. How that man can be ſaid to have a ſufficient means for that to which he is not at the preſent enabled, let other men divine, for I cannot. Sufficiency if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in other terms, is thus, <hi>Poſitis omnibus requiſitis;</hi> and thus all of his own ſide define it, to be a poſition of all things neceſſary and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite; Now if hee be not enabled without the doing and having a further ſupplement, there is no kind of ſufficiencie. Hee ſeeketh to illuſtrate it, and his very illuſtration diſcovers the vanity of this his pretended mediate ſufficiencie; it is thus: <hi>Though wee have not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency at preſent, to ſpeak in an unknown tongue, as Spaniſh, or the like, yet we have a remote ſufficiency, becauſe we have the principles of Reaſon and Underſtanding, by which we may come, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein</p>
            <p n="1">1. His own expreſſes overthrow him; he ſaith, <hi>Though we have not a ſufficiency at preſent, yet we have a remote:</hi> By which I perceive, that by his remote ſufficiencie, he means a poſſibility of a ſufficiencie. But this in its very notion implyeth that a ſufficiencie is not in act; and then the heathen have not a ſufficiencie: but onely are in a capacitie of having it: if he intend it thus, it ſerves him nor, neither will I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This maketh me think that there is ſome fraud in Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> changing his expreſſes, uſing ſometimes <hi>ſufficiency,</hi> ſometimes <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie;</hi> but this is not ingenuouſly done: for theſe are very far diſtant, and ſo far that the one doth no whit imply the other. Nay, ſo far are they diſtant one from the other, that the one doth exclude the other; for <hi>Capacity</hi> implyies onely a power or poſſibility to receive; but <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi> intimates the preſent poſition or enjoyment of ſuch means: Thoſe things which we have already, we are not properly ſaid to be in a capacity of them; and ſo <hi>è contra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Sufficiency is ſuch a thing as is determined to an individuall poſition of all neceſſaries, otherwiſe no ſufficiencie; and where that is, there is a ſufficiencie. But a <hi>capacity</hi> is ſuch a wild and undetermined notion, that we know not where it ſhould fix its foot. True, a man is in a capacity of learning the Spaniſh tongue, when hee hath the uſe of reaſon and his underſtanding; but may we not ſay he is in a capacity of learning it when he is born, becauſe he may come to have the uſe of his underſtanding, and ſo further? and why muſt we ſtay here? May
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:118748:49"/>
he not be ſaid to be in a capacity, though ſomewhat more remote, when he is begotten? for then is he in a capacity of being born, and ſo of coming to the uſe of his underſtanding; and may not this capacity thus run <hi>in infinitum?</hi> Thus wee may affirm, that <hi>Adam</hi> had a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie to beleeve in innocencie, becauſe he was in a remote capacity, he had underſtanding and the uſe of his reaſon; nay thus may he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed aſſert all men to have a ſufficiencie of believing in Chriſt without any means tending thereunto, becauſe they have the uſe of theſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: But this is but meer trifling; ſo that in his next he may leave out this diſtinction. I grant his <hi>Capacity,</hi> but deny his <hi>Sufficiency:</hi> and his mediate ſufficiency is none truly ſo called.</p>
            <p>A ſecond diſtinction I finde in the ſame Diſpute with <hi>Mr. Simpſon</hi> where he diſtinguiſheth thus;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 64.</note> 
               <hi>There is a ſufficiency by which a man is enabled the more eaſily to do a thing; and a ſufficiency, that is, ſuch a thing without which he cannot do the thing,</hi> viz. <hi>the act of beleeving.</hi> And this is more confuſed and impolite then the former. In the firſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber there is an intire diſtiction couched; and if he had ſpoken ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtically, he ſhould have ſaid thus, There is a ſufficiency <hi>ad rem,</hi> and another <hi>ad modum rei;</hi> one ſufficiency to the thing, and another to the manner of doing; for that which is ſufficient to the thing barely, is not ſufficient to this or that manner of doing. An ordinary power had been ſufficient to have barely cured <hi>Peters</hi> mother of a feaver, but none but an extraordinary miraculous power ſerved to cure her in an inſtant. But he immethodically giveth it us thus: <hi>That is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency by which we are enabled more eaſily to beleeve.</hi> As if that grace by which men are onely enabled to beleeve, were not as truly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to the act of believing, as that which hee ſpeaketh of to the more eaſie way and manner of believing. That which excludeth an entire diſtinction, is not providently produced as one member of an imperfect diſtinction.</p>
            <p>The ſecond member of his diſtinction is ſuch as was never heard to come out of any mans ſtudy; it is an uncouth and illiterate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of ſufficiency, which agrees to many things that cannot be called ſufficient. Hee ſaith, <hi>That is ſufficient, without which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the action to be done.</hi> It is ſtrange that he did not conſider, that without his legs he cannot be an integrall man; but I hope hee will not ſay, that his legs are ſufficent to make him an integrall man, there will be ſomething elſe required. A man cannot ſee without his eyes; but his eyes are not ſufficient to make him ſee a thing; there muſt be a viſible object, a well diſpoſed <hi>medium,</hi> a fit and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable diſtance. A man cannot aſcend to the top of the ladder, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee aſcend the firſt ſteps; but I hope the aſcending up the firſt ſteps is not ſufficient to make him attain the top of it. In a word, of every or any one requiſite it may be ſaid, that without it a thing cannot be done; but a ſufficiency is not till all requiſites be preſent. And yet theſe are the moſt perſpicuous notions that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſets before us. If he can <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> about Sufficiency no better, we have ſmal ground to hope he will <hi>determine</hi> about it any better.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:118748:50"/>But to proceed to what he ſaith in the ſeverall following pages in his Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>All that I finde of moment in the 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his Treatiſe is reducible to theſe four Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That every man can uſe the light of Nature conſcientiouſly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That every heathen man may, and that in ſo doing be doth quit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſome degree of well-pleaſing to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That there is a ſtanding courſe of providence whereby God hath tyed himſelf not to faile to reveale Chriſt, and give further grace to ſuch as improve naturall gifts, from that Text,</hi> Habenti dabitur, <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That upon this ground all men have a remote ſufficiency of having Chriſt revealed, and believing in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A very fair and plauſible way (as Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> thinks) to make out his pretended Sufficiency. And upon theſe four Pillars ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole Fabrick of this his ſecond pretended Method, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by by hee proveth his univerſall ſufficiency. Now a full and cleare Anſwer will be made to him in counter-arguing in every one of theſe; and therefore I deny all theſe particulars, and in theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pages prove,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That no heathen man can improve the naturall gifts gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him well (as Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> expreſſeth it) regularly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That if he could, yet he could not at all pleaſe God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That there is no ſuch ſtanding courſe of Providence of giving the increaſe of his grace, as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> pretendeth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though all were granted, yet will it not follow, that a man hath a ſufficiency of believing in Chriſt. And when I ſhall have performed my task in all theſe, I hope Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> will bee ſeeking about for another Method to prove his Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, viz. <hi>That no heathen man meerly by the light of nature can improve naturall abilities regularly and conſcientiouſly,</hi> I need not ſpend much time to prove it; thoſe of his own ſide will prove it for me. The Remonſtrants never yet contended for an improvement of naturall gifts without the aſſiſting grace of God; and but onely ſo much as to do the things contained in the Law: But this is far ſhort of improving naturall abilities regularly and conſcientiouſly. And if the Remonſtrants did purpoſely uſe the term of aſſiſting grace, to avoid the charge of Pelagianiſme, how can <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> avoid it, when hee urgeth this, that men can improve natural abilities; yea, more then that, believe in Chriſt, only by the light of nature?</p>
            <p>But to drive on this buſineſſe to ſome faire iſſue: <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> muſt know, That for a man to improve abilities regularly, is beyond the materiality, and includeth the very formality of a good action; and that a good thing be done in a good manner, according to rule, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118748:50"/>
conſcientiouſly;<note place="margin">Corv. in Molin. cap. <hi>34.</hi> §. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note> which the Remonſtrants affirm to conſtitute the reality, and truth, and ſubſtance of a good action: And can the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man do this without the renewing and regenerating grace of God? The Remonſtrants yeeld ingenuouſly thus; <hi>That man can do nothing that is good, without he be renewed in all his faculties.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Script. Synod. Art. <hi>3.</hi> pag <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> Then certainly not improve naturall abilities in a regular way; for that, according to them, is a ſaving good, becauſe it is tending to, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>But when Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaith, A heathen man can regularly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove natural abilities; hee implyes, that that improvement muſt be according to rule; which rule muſt either be the rule of Nature, or the law of God, or the law of the Goſpel, or the rule of Conſcience. To examine all theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A heathen man by the light of nature cannot improve abilities ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of Nature, or law of Nature; for to do thus,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Non dicit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolus, Gentes legem implere; ſed ea quae ſunt legis facere; <hi>ſc.</hi> faciliora aliqua.

               </gap>, according to the rule. Saith <hi>Corvinus, It is moſt true, that in this ſenſe, it is not poſſible, that any man can ſerve God without faith: But it is queſtionable, whether without faith a man cannot worſhip, although not according to the rule, yet in ſome way and manner, although but imperfectly.</hi> Then certainly Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> walketh in a very unſafe and difficult way in contending for an ability in the heathen to improve their natural abilities according to the rule or law of nature.</p>
            <p>Beſide, to walk according to the light and law of Nature, is to walk according to the rule of Conſcience; for the law of Nature is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the law of God engraven in the hearts and conſciences of men; and here Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> joynes them together, [regular and conſcientious improvement:] But then I hope, hee muſt meane a rightly guided and informed conſcience: elſe how ſhould it be a rule? A crooked rule will never bring men to the ſtraight way of holineſſe. I hope, that neither Maſter <hi>Goodwin,</hi> nor any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian will ſay, that the uſe of Naturals according to the dictate of a miſguided and erring Conſcience, leads either to a further degree of grace or glory. But then conſider alſo, That men not having their conſciences rightly informed and diſpoſed, cannot be ſaid to walke ſo regularly, as to fetch from God increaſe of grace;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118748:51"/>
but ſuch is the caſe of all men by nature without the grace of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>To conſider this a little more diſtinctly. Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> (I hope) well knoweth, that to the regular improvement of every heathen man, there is required both a Rule and Practice; and they are to afford both, not only to do thoſe things contained in the law; but they are to be <hi>a law to themſelves, Rom.</hi> 2. Now ſeeing that they are to afford the law and rule within them, I hope, they will ſay, it muſt be a right and ſtraight rule; a rightly diſpoſed and a good conſcience; otherwiſe, to walk after the rule of an evill conſcience, will not be found an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement or uſe, but rather an abuſe of naturall gifts. An evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſuch from which we are to be cleanſed, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.22. But from an improvement of naturall gifts, or from the right rule leading thereunto there is no need of being waſhed. Now where is this right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guided and good conſcience amongſt the heathen? All men are divided into two ranks by the Apoſtle; into the <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Impure:</hi> the pure have all things pure, the impure and unbelieving all things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note>

               </note> 
               <hi>Conſcience is but a ſubordinate rule, as it is directed by the Word of God.</hi> Men have not improved their abilities by walking according to their conſciences: <hi>Paul</hi> was a perſecuter: and many come to kill and put to death the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as for the light of the heathen, whereby they may be directed to the obſervance of God in a way of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Alas, what is it? Well may the Remonſtrants ſay, it is <hi>relicks of life,</hi> and <hi>ſparks of knowledg,</hi> and that they have <hi>aliquam cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitionem Dei,</hi> ſome kind and meaſure of the knowledg of God: but alas, what is it? not ſo high as to be a rule of an acceptable improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Abilities.</p>
            <p>I would that <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> had put forth ſome Diſcourſe of naturall light, that wee might examine the ſubject of it, and the penetrative vigour thereof. True indeed, the <hi>Heavens declare the glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>Inviſible things of God are to be ſeen in the viſible creatures.</hi> But here the glory of God is in the creatures, but as light is in the Sun; which yet is not actually ſeen by blind men. To the act of ſight there is not only required a viſible object, but there muſt be a well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed organ; and the eye muſt be open. Now true it is, that the <hi>heavens declare the glory of God,</hi> as the Sun diſplayes his light; but the heavens do not open the eys, or give light to the ſimple, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.4, 5, 6, 7. What improvement can Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> produce that ever was made by the rule of natural knowledg? The Apoſtle telleth us, that <hi>the Gentiles are alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the life of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.18. 2 Pet. 1.9</note> 
               <hi>and that through the ignorance that is in them; having their mindes darkened.</hi> Man now in the ſtate of corruption, whatever the light be that ſhines in the creatures, hee is but <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118748:51"/>
the true God, but that thereby they may know how to worſhip the true God, and ſerve him, or that their light is or can be a rule of a right and true Improvement of natural ability, I leave as Maſter <hi>Goodwin's</hi> task to prove either by Scripture or good reaſon; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch an Improvement, upon which all the adminiſtrations of God to men tending to ſalvation ſhall proceed. Now until that Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> cleareth theſe two things; Firſt, that the Heathen can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford within themſelves the rule of a right Improvement of their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: or, Secondly, that ſuppoſe they have the rule within them; yet that they can exerciſe ſuch a regular Improvement according to the rule in a perfect Obedience: (for he that faileth in any one thing, walketh not according to rule, and maketh not a regular Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement) I ſhall conclude that no Heathen man can make a regular Improvement of his abilities, that is, neither according to the rule of Conſcience or Law of Nature, and as for any Law of the Goſpel or Poſitive Law of God: there is no need that any diſpute proceed upon theſe, becauſe in the very foundation of this diſcourſe, it is ſuppoſed that thoſe are not revealed to the Heathen. But ere I paſs, I ſhall urge one only argument to prove that a Heathen man cannot make any regular Improvement of his natural abilities, and it is thus.</p>
            <q>
               <p>If the natural man be enmity againſt God, and neither is nor can be ſubject to the Law of God, then he cannot make a regular Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his natural abilities.</p>
               <p>But the former is true, <hi>Rom. 8.6, 7, 8.</hi> Therefore the latter in true alſo.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now to this Argument, I for the preſent conceive, that two things chiefly may be replied.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he may ſay, that text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. ſpeaks of the Poſitive and Moral Law of God; but we are treating of the Law of Nature. Now to the Laws of Nature we yield Obedience by Nature, but to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law of God by Grace. If Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> pleaſe to urge this or any thing like it, then I refer it to him to prove that the Law of Nature and Poſitive Law of God be different in ſubſtance, and not in that reſpect one and the ſame, ſave only in the manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery: the one internally inſcribed, the other externally manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Again, he muſt conſider, that the dint of the Argument is in this, that the natural minde is enmity againſt God: the enmity of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men is originally againſt God: and ſo by conſequence againſt any Law of God, whether internally inſcribed, or outwardly given: the Law of Nature is as well the Law of God as any of his Poſitive Lawes, and ſo equally occaſions the enmity of a natural man; For <hi>(Quae conveniunt in aliquo tertio conveniunt inter ſe:)</hi> both theſe Lawes being the Lawes of God, and the natural mans Enmity being originally againſt both theſe Laws, agree in this, that the natural man cannot be ſubject to them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Be it ſo, then we muſt enquire whether the Heathen men be not ſo, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, their gloſs overthroweth their doctrine, their gloſs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth many Heathen to be without all knowledge of God. When yet their whole Doctrine in this point urgeth ſo much of Divine Knowledge in every man, that they may improve their natural abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and are ſufficiently enabled thereunto.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they would have man conſidered in his meer corrupt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, that is, without all knowledge of God and aſſiſtance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; ſo that in their doctrine to have the knowledge and aſſiſting Spirit of God, is to reduce them from the corrupt and natural eſtate, which knowledge and grace they pretend that every man in the world hath without exception; and hence we come to ſee that this is the ſumme of their Doctrine, that now no man is in his corrupt eſtate, or can be called a natural man, which will render the Apoſtles words very vain and empty.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this anſwer is grounded upon that exotick tripartition of the World, which we finde in all their works: They ſay (man is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meerly natural; or natural, yet diſpoſed to regeneration; or thirdly, regenerate:) it matters not what our corrupt mindes may ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to us to the maintenance of our opinions, when <hi>Molin</hi> ſaith, that <hi>(The fear of God doth not agree to thoſe that are unregenerate;) Corvinus</hi> thus replyeth,<note place="margin">Si per irrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitos intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis eos qui a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimum planè à Deo averſum habent, verum dicis, ſed ſi per irregenitos eos intelligis qui nondum ſunt regeniti, erras. <hi>cap.</hi> 34 §. 4.</note>

Let them make it appear, that theſe notions are not the iſſue meerly of wanton and luxuriant brains; the Scripture thus only divideth, All man are either born of the fleſh, or born of the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. either live after the fleſh, or after the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4, 5, 6. Either carnally minded, or ſpiritually minded, <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. and it ſaith in general, <hi>[As
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118748:52"/>
many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the ſons of God,]</hi> Rom. 8.14. that is, ſo many as are led by the ſweet ducture of the Spirit of God, to do any thing in tendency to ſalvation, are the ſons of God, and ſo born again: and of ſuch it cannot be ſaid, they are unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. But more ſhall be ſaid to this purpoſe, when I ſee Maſter <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins,</hi> replyes to this argument, and till I ſee them, I ſhall conclude a Heathen man cannot improve his abilities regularly, becauſe the natural man is enmity againſt God, and cannot be ſubject to his Law.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I am to conſider the ſecond main Pillar upon which this pretended method ſtands, and that is, whether a Heathen man by the light of nature, can by his Improvements, or any other thing, quit himſelf to a degree of well-pleaſing to God. Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> affirms it, I in this ſecond particular counter-argue him thus:</p>
            <p>That no Heathen man can pleaſe God by any ſuch Improvement as he is able to make of his natural abilities, If it appear that man cannot by nature improve his natural gifts, upon that defect I know Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> himſelf will grant that man cannot pleaſe God; ſo that till he can make good the firſt particular, we are ſafe enough here; but I ſhall go a little further: Suppoſe man could improve his natural abilities, yet could he not be ſaid to pleaſe God; what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency can any man diſcover from Scripture, if God takes in the performances and perſons of men without faith before they be born again, &amp; become his ſons in Chriſt? the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.6.</note> 
               <hi>He hath made us accepted in the beloved,</hi> Epheſ. 1.6. Now I ſhall give the Remonſtrants leave ſo far as to be the interpreters of this and the reſt the of like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in this Chap. In the fourth Verſe he ſaith, <hi>He hath elected us, (in Chriſt;)</hi> now ſay the Remonſtrants <hi>(us in Chriſt)</hi> that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>elected us being (in Chriſt)</hi> that is, believing in act; &amp; hence they contend that none are Elected but ſuch as are believers either in act or in the divine preſcience, then I hope they wil not repine if I ſay here, from this text <hi>(He hath made us accepted in the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)</hi> that is, we being in Chriſt actually believers, with whom and by which faith he is well pleaſed with us, and that none are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, or he well pleaſed with any, but thoſe that are in Chriſt; me thinks they might have ſo much fore-ſight as not to give ſuch gloſſes upon any expreſſion in one place that will ſtrangle their own ſenſe in another text. But again, the Remonſtrants willingly confeſſe, that no man can fulfil the Law of nature perfectly or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God according to the rule, and then will they ſay that God is pleaſed with lame and imperfect performances? <hi>He that faileth in one point, becomes guilty of all.</hi> Nay, but ſuppoſe they could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the light of nature to the height of the rule of nature; yet how would they pleaſe God by ſo doing? All the obedience to the Law of God Poſitive and Moral, cannot pleaſe God without Chriſt.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118748:53"/>
The people of God have confeſſed,<note place="margin">Iſaiah 64.6.</note> 
               <hi>that their righteouſneſs is as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous rags in his ſight:</hi> then certainly, the natural performances of the Heathen, though never ſo regular, cannot pleaſe God. <hi>Paul</hi> with all his moral righteouſneſs, though in relation to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law he was blameleſs, yet accounted that but dung (which is not acceptable to man) in compariſon of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that he might be found in it, but certainly he would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count any thing dung that was acceptable to God, or with which he was pleaſed. Now the Apoſtle ſpeaks here not comparatively, that is, his righteouſneſs of the law was <hi>dung and loſs in compariſon of Chriſt,</hi> but abſolutely he accompted <hi>his own righteouſneſs dung, that he might win Chriſt:</hi> or ſuch conceits that our own righteouſneſs pleaſeth God, hinder us either from the ſeeking or obteining the righteouſneſs of Chriſt.

            <p>Again, the Heathen (let their Improvement be never ſo high and eminent) are but unregenerate, and not born again, and therefore but yet in the fleſh,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.6, 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>But thoſe that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> But I ſhall reduce all to one perſpicuous Argument, and that is this.</p>

               </p>
               <p>(If a man cannot perform thoſe actions by which he may pleaſe God, without faith which is the gift of God, then he cannot of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>But the former is true: Therefore the latter is true).</p>
            </q>
            <p>The formation of which Argument made the anſwer of <hi>Corvinus</hi> to be ſo ready at hand, which was, That the concluſion of the argument is nothing againſt them, they pretending the aſſiſting Spirit of God, they hold not any man can of himſelf without the grace of God do any thing to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding this argument is valid enough againſt Maſter <hi>Goodwin:</hi> becauſe he is not ſo expreſs in the point of aſſiſting grace, as the Remonſtrants are, but is all for the light of nature onely; but becauſe I will make it firm againſt all parties, I deſire to form it thus:
<q>
                  <p>(If no man without faith can pleaſe God, then no man can by all his Improvemements pleaſe God before faith.</p>
                  <p>But the former is true: Therefore the latter.)</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And to this <hi>Corvinus</hi> hath an anſwer at hand, ſuch an one as we
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:118748:53"/>
finde it, thus: <hi>[Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>doth not well prove,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6. Male probat nullam actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem quae Deo placcat prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fari poſſe, quia ibi agitur de tali beneplaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to quo quis placet Deo ad gloriam. <hi>Corvin. in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. c.</hi> 33. §. 4.

               <hi>that no action can be done to pleaſe God without faith. Becauſe that text means ſuch a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing whereby a man pleaſeth God to glory]</hi> how they ſweat at it to ſtrangle a clear text?</p>
            <p>Firſt, I demand how that appeareth from the text? that it meaneth ſuch a pleaſing, whereby a man pleaſeth God to glory, he gives the reaſon why thus, in the ſame place, <hi>[becauſe it ſpeaks of that pleaſing, whereby he pleaſed God when God tranſlated him;]</hi> but this is a manifeſt forgery: for, ſaith the text <hi>(before he was tranſlated he had this teſtimony, that he pleaſed God: but without faith a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God.)</hi> If then the Text ſpeak of ſuch a pleaſing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſed God before the tranſlation of him, then it is but a meer ſhift of diverſion to confine it to ſuch whereby <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſed God when he tranſlated him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is not becauſe of the long interval, that <hi>Corvinus</hi> cannot at his turn remember, that he was one of that full Jury of Remonſtrants who urge this Argument to the clearing of their doctrine, in the firſt article from this very place thus:
<q>
                  <p>That without which we cannot pleaſe God, without it we cannot be elected to life.</p>
                  <p>But without faith we cannot pleaſe God, <hi>Heb. 11.6.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore without faith it is impoſſible for any one to be elected to ſalvation.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, I ſhall make uſe both of this argument it ſelf, as alſo their reply to our anſwer; to refel their futilous gloſs, firſt, the argument it ſelf overthrows them, if this text be to be taken in ſuch ſenſe as whereby a man pleaſeth God to glory (that is, actually to give glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) then their Propoſition or Major, muſt be corrected and run thus:
<q>That without which we cannot pleaſe God to glory, without it a man be elected to glory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And let any <hi>Arminian</hi> look upon the face of this Propoſition, and tell me if it pleaſe them, and whether this be like their doctrine, that no man can pleaſe God ſo far as to Elect him, without that by which he will ſo far pleaſe him as to give him glory; and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence he ſhall give glory to ſo many as he elects. What will then become of their doctrine of falling away, and that thoſe that are now elected may afterwards come to be reprobated, and never ſo pleaſe God, as to give them glory? and if the caſe be ſuch then, what egregious foul dealing are they guilty of, to forge ſuch a gloſs againſt the cleer text at this turn; when yet they are forced to relinquiſh it in another?</p>
            <p>Secondly, to conſider the Anſwer of the Contra-Remonſtrants to this argument thus: <hi>[Faith is taken two wayes, either for faith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or for faith fore-ſeen; the text runs upon faith preſent, but the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118748:54"/>
question upon faith foreſeen, therefore the text cannot agree with the question.]</hi> To this Anſwer, although very pertinent and plauſible, yet the Remonſtrants with an open mouth reply thus.</p>
            <p>[<note n="(a)" place="margin">Quis non videt quàm Contra-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, quia Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoli pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum eſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lututum &amp; u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſale. <hi>Sine fide nemo poteſt Deo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere? Act. Synod. ibi.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Who ſeeth not the Contra-Remonstrants to be at a ſtand here, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaying of the Apoſtle is univerſal and abſolute without faith a man cannot pleaſe God]</hi> but <hi>(mutato nomine de Remonſtrantibus nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur fabula;)</hi> or the Remonſtrants may well bear with us, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſometimes to be at a ſtand, then alwayes in a precipice, falling down-right upon the truth in wilful contradictions: for if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles words be univerſal and abſolute, <hi>Without faith no man can pleaſe God,</hi> why then I pray muſt it now be confined and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuch a pleaſing <hi>(viz.)</hi> to glory? Is it ſuch an offence for us to diſtinguiſh of the word <hi>(faith)</hi> becauſe the words of the Apoſtle are univerſal and abſolute? and may they take the licence to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh of the word <hi>(pleaſe?)</hi> by what law, I pray? or what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? for according to their own ſenſe <hi>(placere Deo)</hi> to pleaſe God is immanent in God; but <hi>(to give glory)</hi> is external to God; the queſtion is not, what followes our pleaſing of God, but what goeth before it; not what he doth by our pleaſing of him, but what we do whereby he comes to be pleaſed with us: and their gloſs to this purpoſe is altogether heterogeneous and impertinent. <hi>(Pleaſing to glory?)</hi> then it ſeemeth there is one degree of pleaſing, to give the Goſpel; another, to give faith; a third, to give glory; and ſo that which is in their doctrine immanent in God, ſhall be capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, and remiſſion: where ſhall they finde proof for theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? I ſhall expect it.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid thus much in this buſineſs, becauſe if Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> having conſulted with them, ſhall reply theſe things, I prevent him, and eaſe my ſelf, in putting things as far as I may: or if Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> pleaſe to interpoſe other replies, I am readie to receive them.</p>
            <p>Or if this place or phraſe do not pleaſe Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> I ſhall give him another, and ſo let him take both together thus:
<q>
                  <p>If no man that is in the fleſh can pleaſe God, then not the Heathen by all their improvements, onely by the light of nature:</p>
                  <p>But no man that is in the fleſh can pleaſe God, <hi>Rom. 8.6, 7.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the heathen cannot pleaſe God, &amp;c.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This argument is grounded on this: All men till regenerated are in the fleſh; and ſo long as they remain onely with the light of nature, they are unregenerated: till theſe arguments be anſwered, I ſhall conclude, that no Heathen can by his improvements pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in the next place I am to make good, that ſuppoſe man could both improve his naturals well, and thereby pleaſe God, yet there is no ſuch ſtanding courſe of providence, whereby God doth proceed to the revealing Chriſt and working faith and ſo give ſalvation, which courſe Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> affirms: I on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:118748:54"/>
ſay, there is no ſuch, neither doth that text <hi>(Habemi dabitur) To him that hath ſhall be given,</hi> import any ſuch thing: If M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> take a ſurvey of the Scriptures, he ſhall find that there is no ſtanding courſe of providence in any of his diſpenſations whether natural or ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>We ſhall find in Scripture moſt frequently, that much is given to them that had the leaſt in poſſeſſion or in improvement or in diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſomtimes God is found of them that ſeek him; hence that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is given, and a promiſe is annexed, <hi>(Seek, and ye ſhall find;)</hi> but there is no ſtanding courſe for this; For ſometimes, yea, very oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en he is (<hi>found of them that ſeek him not;</hi>

               <note place="margin">Rom. 11.33.</note> 11.33. And what is that depth he telleth us in the 30. <hi>verſe,</hi> that they who have not yet believed <hi>(the Gentiles)</hi> no nor yet were diſpoſed to believe, ſhould yet receive the Goſpel. It is remarkable, how the Gentiles all along are branded with the black mark of all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and a reprobate ſenſe, the Gentiles are made the ſtandard and meaſure of all laciviouſneſſe, exceſſe, revellings, and all kindes of Idolatry, to commit theſe is to worke the will of the Gentiles.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.4, 5.</note> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.4, 5. what diſpoſitions or improvements are there found in theſe, now when we ſhall conſider, that God taketh away the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, from the Jew and gives it to theſe Gentiles? true it is, there is ſome cauſe why he might take it away from the Jew, but what was there that he ſhould give it to the Gentiles? was it <hi>(To him that hath ſhall be given?)</hi> what had the Gentiles, or did they, to fetch this diſcoverie of the Goſpel from the Almighty?

               </gap>, that admirable depth of goodneſſe and wiſdome. Nay, let me go a litle further, when God choſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be his people, and to diſcover his Word and will to them, what ſtanding courſe of providence was there ſeen in that? what improvement was there? if any, let Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> reconcile them to <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8.

            <p>

And yet although by theſe clouds of witneſſes they are forced to confeſſe that there can be no exact reaſon given of Gods diſpenſations of grace either by the uſe or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of natural gifts, yet they can (to make out that intention in God to ſave all) affirm that [<note n="(a)" place="margin">Nullus co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum quos com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni vocatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vocat quem non ex primâ intentione ideò vocet ut eos ſpecialioris gratiâ vocatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis afficiat. <hi>Script.

               <hi>No man that enjoyes that generall and common Call (which is the ſame with the generall gifts they before ſpoke of) but God calleth them out of his primary intention, to endew them with the grace of his more ſpecial call;]</hi> how miſerable is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of that houſe, that the ſtrengthening of one part is the confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another? true indeed if they did grant any ſuch ſtanding, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act rule for Gods diſpenſations of grace, then they might thus evade us, all things propounded and intended by his primary and ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent will, fall not out ſo in execution by his conſequent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe man is wanting to himſelf; there is the intervening peccancie of mans free wil; but they take this evaſion out of their own mouths, for if no ſuch exact or ſtanding rule be, ſo that we cannot tell how grace ſhall be diſpenſed either by the uſe or abuſe of general gifts, then how God may be truely ſaid to give general gifts intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally that by improvement of them he might in dew men with more ſpecial grace; let them that can, divine: for I profeſſe my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to do it.</p>
            <p>Again, one thing more if there be ſuch a method (which out of the fluttering expreſſes of our Adverſaries may be made out) that general gifts are given to every man with an intention that they might improve them, and upon the inprovement of them be compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated with the revelation of Chriſt, and the improvement of that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:118748:55"/>
with more grace, till they come to be ſaved, and that all this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod from nature to glory (by the reaſon of the irrefragable contig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation betwixt all the parts thereof) be but one entire way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and eternal glory, then I demand of Maſter <hi>Goodwin,</hi> whether thoſe that believe in Chriſt are more truly ſaid to have life then thoſe that have only the gifts of nature, and how Chriſt is ſaid to be the way? When yet the Heathen are in the way, and yet are without Chriſt; and how the Heathen are ſaid to have gone out of the way, and not to have known the way of peace, when Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> can tell us they have the light of nature, which is a part of that way that leads to life, what doth he think is the difference betwixt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Chriſt, and the Heathen Gentiles? Doth he think them alike in this, that they are both in the way to life, and only this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that the one hath gone further in this way then the other. Thoſe that are believers may (in Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> judgement) final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall away and periſh, and the Lord Chriſt hath not promiſed to preſerve them from their voluntary defections; and their faith in Chriſt may yet ſo fail them, as that they ſhall not come to life: and yet on the other ſide, a Heathen man hath general gifts given to him with this intention, that he might improve them, and improving them have an increaſe of grace till they come to be ſaved, how ſhall we herein diſcry any difference betwixt them: and that the one ſhall appear to be more truly in the way to life then the other? his deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons herein wil be acceptable, and provoke me to further explanations in this particular; only I muſt adviſe him to be caſting about for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proofs for this, that thoſe Heathen men that have only the light of nature, can be ſaid to know the way of peace, and to be in the way of eternal life; otherwiſe I ſhall not yield to this ſtanding courſe of providence, ſo much, and ſo confidently urged by him.</p>
            <p>But then in the next place, he will urge us with that text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. the Parable of the talents, in which it is ſaid <hi>(To him that hath it ſhall be given:)</hi> from this text they deduce this generall or ſtanding courſe of providence: and hence, ſay they, it appears, that God bindes himſelf to give increaſe to him that uſeth thoſe gifts well, that he hath received, nay, Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaith expreſly, that here by talents are meant natural gifts, and in that ſaying <hi>(To him that hath ſhall be given)</hi> God promiſes to give an increaſe of grace to him that ſhall uſe the light of nature well.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe this text is the whole proof, by the ſtrength of which the whole fabrick of <hi>

But to take a ſurvey of their conſtancy in this particular, <hi>Arminius</hi> would have the talents be the (light of nature) he ſaith thus.

               <hi>The ſentence is general, wherein the Lord ſpeaks nothing but this, that he will compenſate the right uſe of gifts received with greater liberality.]</hi> Here the talents are ſo laxly interpreted, as that we may make them either nature or grace or both, or, if ſuch could poſſibly be, neither. Sometimes the talents are natural light, ſometimes grace, ſometimes either or both, and may we finde Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> any thing more certain to his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? In the 20th. page of his Book he urgeth (that the talents are natural gifts, and can be underſtood of nothing elſe by any colour of reaſon,) and yet in the 18th. page, he gives himſelf a little more room, and ſaith, that that text avoucheth that, <hi>[That whatſoever a mans ſtock or endowments is in one kinde or other from Gods hand, yet by a careful improvement it may ariſe to a ſpiritual eſtate.]</hi> and in the 21th. page further ſaith quite contrary, that <hi>[Thoſe abilities that are given to man, are more commonly then properly called natural,]</hi> and is it not likely that we ſhould give ſatisfactory anſwers to them, who cannot yet make any ſetled and ſatisfactory demands? but it ſeems I muſt do it as well as I may.

            <p>Firſt, what is meant by talents, the true <hi>examen</hi> of this will help us to decide all the reſt, and I ſhall proceed upon this ground, if theſe words make any thing for their invented or ſtanding providence, they muſt either by talents underſtand natural gifts, or elſe at leaſt take them in: but becauſe I am to deal with Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> I ſhall conſider his own words in this caſe: <hi>[There is no ground nor colour of reaſon to think but that all the talents mentioned in the parable, the five, the two, and the one, were all of one kinde and nature, and ſignified not any ſupernatural or ſaving grace, but only natural abilities, and ſuch as men unregenerate as well as regenerate are capable of.]</hi> But then,</p>
            <p n="1">1 How inconſtant is he to himſelf? for in the 21 page he ſaith, that theſe talents and endowments are more commonly then properly called natural, &amp; yet here he is ſo aſſertive of this great Impropriety,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118748:56"/>
as to ſay, that it cannot upon any ground or colour of reaſon be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for any thing but natural endowments.</p>
            <p n="2">2 I anſwer by conceſſion, &amp; grant all the talents to be of one kinde and nature; yea, and the increaſe to be of the ſame nature with the talents, but this is no favourable plea for Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> cauſe, which would have nature to be the talents, and grace the increaſe: but of this more preſently.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Supppſe they be all of one kinde, muſt that needs be natural? what colour of reaſon is there for this inference? may they not be ſupernatural, and yet be all of one kinde alſo? but he hath one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that ſeemeth to carry in it the force of a reaſon; and that is this: <hi>[Such as men unregenerate have as well as the regenerate,]</hi> and his reaſon ſeemeth to be this, <hi>[Thoſe talents were given to that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that was cast into utter darkneſs, and ſo to the unregenerate, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be underſtood of natural abilities:]</hi> but this is very miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reaſoning, as if ſupernatural grace was not given to the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, how then ſhould they come to be regenerate? or if it be ſuch as the regenerate have with the unregenerate, it muſt be more then natural, except he will ſay, that men become regenerate meerly by nature; but if he have here miſtaké a word, <hi>unregenerate</hi> (putting <hi>men)</hi> for <hi>(men that ſhall periſh)</hi> as I think he hath (becauſe in the foregoing page, I finde him molding the expreſſion ſo:) I ſhall not take the advantage, but conſider it running thus, and yet I ſay, who ever hath ſaid that God may not give ſupernatural grace to them that ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh? or that this is good reaſoning (ſuch means are given to men that ſhall periſh, therefore they are only natural gifts.) <hi>Many ſhall ſay, We have propheſied in thy Name, of whom he ſhall ſay, I know ye not;</hi> the incredulous Jews were men that ſhould periſh, yet I hope they had ſupernatural grace of the Goſpel.

            <p>But we have a very fair flouriſh, and becauſe reaſon is but ſlender, authority muſt carry it: for he ſaith, That there is not one of our beſt Interpreters, but they adjudge the caſe for him, and that they are unanimous for natural abilities.

And hereby <hi>we are changed into the ſame image,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.) ſo that this is not reaſon, as it is by nature or abilities meerly natural; but as they are elevated by the ſupernatural grace of God, and I am induced to think ſo, becauſe I finde other Fathers ſpeaking of the ſame buſineſs, to the ſame purpoſe, as <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> though not in his original language, yet, as <hi>Anianus,</hi> and other uncertain Interpreters lay it down thus: [<note n="(d)" place="margin">Abſcondit autem talen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in terrâ, qui accipiens notitiam Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti contemnit vitam ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, &amp; in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venis actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp; deliciis converſans ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruit illam in carne ſuâ, &amp; mundi ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinibus quaſi ſpinis ſuffocat ſuaefidel bonum &amp; fructum non fert. <hi>Chryſoſt.

And this is the height of his authority. But becauſe he ſeems to look alſo at colour of reaſon, and pretendeth that there is neither colour nor ground of reaſon for any man to think that the talents ſignifie any thing but natural abilities; I ſhall in the next place produce ſeverall particulars, which to my underſtanding carry ſome colour of reaſon; by them I intend to prove that by the talents are not meant natural abilities.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To underſtand the talents of natural abilities, takes away all pertinency and aptneſs, either to the perſons ſpoken to, or the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſpeaking, from the words of Chriſt: which yet we are upon very neceſſary principles to grant to them: the perſons to whom theſe words were ſpoken, were Jews, who had the letter of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel preached to them; and the occaſion of ſpeaking theſe words, was immediately upon the preaching that parable of the ſower, the ſeed being the Word, it fell on all grounds good and bad, the ſtony, thorny, highway ground; but theſe myſteries our Saviour ſpake in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, the reaſon being asked, he returns this anſwer in both places, <hi>(To him that hath ſhall be given, but from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away that which he hath.)</hi> Now let Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſhew the pertinency of this anſwer in his ſenſe either to the perſons or occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for taking talents for natural abilities, then this is the ſenſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:118748:58"/>
of the place: Becauſe the unbelieving Jews have not (that is) uſe not the light and abilities of nature well, therefore they had not the clear underſtanding of the myſteries of heaven, given to them; but our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our gives the reaſon in the Parable, becauſe the Goſpel in its glorious diſcoveries fell upon their hearts as upon ſtony, high-way, thorny ground: therefore he ſpake to them in Parables, and therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth them to take heed how they heard <hi>(viz.)</hi> the letter of the Goſpel; <hi>For to him that hath ſhall be given, &amp;c.</hi> now to interpret the talents by the light of nature, is very much irrelative to the occaſion of Chriſts words, which was their not uſing of the Goſpel-light in the letter of it, and what an incoherency doth it introduce into Chriſts words, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.18. <hi>[Take heed how ye hear: For to him that hath, ſhall be given, &amp;c?]</hi> for then the ſenſe muſt run thus, Take heed how ye hear the Goſpel, for from them that uſe not the light of nature well, ſhall be taken away the light of nature, even that which they have: the very words of <hi>(taking heed how they hear)</hi> ſeem to carry it hither, that the talents did ſignifie the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This very ſenſe deſtroys his ſtanding courſe of providence, for clear it is that as Chriſt applyeth this proverbiall ſentence, the Jews did not uſe their talents well. Now if by talents be to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood naturall abilities, then the unbelieving Jews did not uſe their naturall abilities well, and yet they had the letter of the Goſpel, and God did not fail to reveal his Son Chriſt to them, elſe how could they be unbelieving? and if he revealed his Son to ſuch as did not uſe their natural abilities regularly, where is Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> ſtanding Courſe of providence, of revealing or hiding his Son Chriſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mens exerciſing or not exerciſing their naturall abilities regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Their talents that were given were <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="4">4 Thoſe talents that were given, were in a various degree to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe men, ſome five, ſome two, ſome one talent; but how can Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> make his to agree with the light of nature, if he conſider his own words,<note place="margin">

               </gap>? I fear this will not eaſily be reduced to right reaſon.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Theſe talents are ſuch as that the improvement of them is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſaying, the perſon that improved and gained other five, the Lord ſaid to him, <hi>Enter thou into the joy of thy Maſter;</hi> but this cannot be affirmed of the abilities of nature, and that neither upon the principles of Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> nor yet of the Remonſtrants joyntly, for in all their endowments, the improvement of the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the height is not immediately ſaving.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Theſe talents were given to his ſervants at his going into a far Countrey, and is not this generally interpreted, at his Aſcenſion? but can it be reduced to right reaſon and evidence of Scripture, to ſay that Chriſt diſtributed naturall abilities at his Aſcenſion? what needed he ſtay till his Aſcenſion for the beſtowing that boon, had he not done it long before? What did all men long before? if he gave not natural abilities till his Aſcenſion? whether will not this Gloſs depretiate thoſe Princely Donatives, with which he ſolemnly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured his Aſcenſion, to bring them ſo low as the abilities of nature?</p>
            <p>Theſe things I lay down, as having afforded much colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if no more, and till theſe be cleared, I cannot think that by talents are meant natural abilities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:118748:59"/>Thus having diſcuſſed the talents, I ſhall examine whether he ſpeak right upon the ſervants to whom theſe talents were given. Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> deſcribeth them very ſuitably to his purpoſe thus: [<hi>By the ſervants who received theſe talents, as in a glaſs we may ſee the condition and ſtate, not of believers only, or thoſe that ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but of the generality of mankinde, or at leaſt of them that ſhall periſh as well as of them that ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Now indeed, if by talents be meant naturall abilities, he had need make the ſervants to be all mankinde, and no other interpretation will ſerve his turn handſomely, and therefore Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> would have us believe, that by the ſervants in the Parable, is meant the ſtate and condition (or more properly the perſons) of all mankinde. But how doth he prove it? he thinketh he proveth it thus: <hi>[Not of thoſe that believe only, or ſuch as ſhall be ſaved,]</hi> as if becauſe thoſe ſervants were ſuch as might periſh, as well as thoſe that believed and were ſaved, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are all mankinde in generall; an inference like the reſt. The ſervants may repreſent the Church of Chriſt on earth, in which are thoſe that ſhall periſh, as well as thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, to whom God may diſpenſe many of his ſupernaturall abilities for the good and edification of his Church, though their perſons pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: and this I hope may well be, and yet not all mankinde come under the notion of his houſhold-ſervants. For we may know from Scripture that Chriſt hath a houſe of his own, &amp; a retinue of his own, the government and edification of which houſe, he hath tranſmitted to ſervants of his own, ſo run the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>He called his own proper ſervants,</hi> the conſideration of which is no propitious glaſs to preſent to us a gloſs of ſuch latitude: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> prove that Chriſt as Mediator, hath received the oeconomy over the whole World, as his houſe and family over which he is maſter and head: I muſt conclude that the ſervants in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable do not ſignifie all mankind in generall, but only thoſe that are within the Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to conſider a little the improvement, or rather the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe upon that improvement, it is evident it is in the ſame kinde, the increaſe was of the one talent that was given to him that had gained five to his five; that which was promiſed to him that hath, was not variety, but abundance in the ſame kinde: ſo that look what the increaſe is, we may conclude, ſuch was the talents improved; but then ſuppoſe we ſhould concede to Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> all he deſireth, that talents ſignifie naturall abilities, and the ſervants all mankinde in generall: yet what would this contribute to his cauſe, which is (that God gives increaſe of ſupernaturall grace to him that uſeth naturall abilities worthily and regularly) wherein the uſe and the increaſe, the thing had and the thing given are <hi>(in diverſo genere;)</hi> the one is natural, the other ſupernatural, which is againſt the current of the Parable; for if the talents given, &amp; the increaſe given; upon improvement, be of one and the ſame kinde then, if the talents
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118748:60"/>
be the abilities of nature,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 20, 21.</note> then the increaſe muſt be naturall alſo, which Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> liketh not, for he ſaith expreſly (it is not an increaſe of natural abilities, but of more ſaving grace) or elſe if the increaſe be ſpiritual grace, then the talents cannot be natural abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, contrary to his preſent doctrine. To ſum up all then together, we may ſee how unhandſomely his aſſertion and this Parable of the talents meet; his aſſertion pleads that the talents originally given are naturall gifts, the Parable ſeemeth to carry it for ſupernatural graces; his aſſertion urgeth that theſe ſervants are all mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, the Parable confines them only to his Church which is Chriſts houſe, and over which he is head and Maſter, and for whoſe uſe he beſtoweth his goods to his ſervants. His aſſertion contendeth for a gift and an increaſe to be <hi>(in diverſo genere)</hi> in a diverſe kinde. The Parable makes both the improvement and increaſe to be <hi>(in eodem genere)</hi> in the ſame kinde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quàm benè conveniunt?</hi> Which being conſidered, we may come to ſee that that Parable of the talents (indeed it upholdeth ſuch a courſe of providence as to bleſs the improvement of grace with more grace, but) holdeth not forth ſuch a courſe of providence as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> pretendeth, which to make an increaſe of grace to them that uſe nature well, becauſe in this courſe of providence, the improvement and the increaſe are of divers kindes, but the Parable holds forth that only, wherein both are in the ſame kinde; and as I have proved there is no ſuch courſe of providence: ſo I have alſo cleared that he hath not proved any ſuch courſe, no not by the ſtrength of that text <hi>[To him that hath ſhall be given.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But fourthly and laſtly, ſuppoſe we grant him all theſe three, that man could improve naturals regularly, and ſo pleaſe God, and ſo procure increaſe of grace according to that ſtanding courſe of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene; yet will it not ſo roundly follow, as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> pretendeth, that all men even the Heathen are in a ſufficiency of means to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; that upon the ground before-mentioned, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to believe requireth all requiſites to the act of believing; now believing the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt is a requiſite, which revelation of Chriſt is not made but upon the actuall and regular improvement (according to the doctrine of Mr. <hi>Goodwin;</hi>) therefore we muſt not inſiſt upon ſuppoſitions, if man improve naturals well, God will reveal Chriſt, and ſo raiſe a Chymericall ſufficiency of believing; for there is no ſufficiency of believing in Chriſt till he be revealed, whom he will reveal (ſaith Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi>) (not upon the capacity of Improvement) but upon the actuall Improvement according to the rule; and that ſtanding courſe of providence, ſo much urged by Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> implyes no more then a not failing to reveal Chriſt upon the actual regular improvement of naturall abilities; they will not ſay that God hath promiſed to reveal Chriſt to thoſe that are able only to improve nature, except they do actually improve it,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:118748:60"/>
therefore it muſt needs follow that the revelation of Chriſt, and the actuall improvement of naturall abilities leading thereunto, are requiſites to believe in Chriſt; and therefore if both be not actually preſent, there is no ſufficiency for believing, otherwiſe why ſhould the Remonſtrants trouble themſelves in framing out a various mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and degree of ſufficiency? And grant that till men do uſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals well, and ſo have Chriſt actually revealed,<note place="margin">Corvin. in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. c. <hi>37. §. 11.</hi>
               </note> there is no ſufficiency of believing in Chriſt? And to come to ſome cloſe in this point, let us grant all they urge, that man can improve his naturals, and to pleaſe God, and by both according to that ſtanding courſe of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence have Chriſt revealed, and ſo believe, and that it were alſo true that if he did all thoſe things before-mentioned, he ſhould have Chriſt revealed, in all this the queſtion is not of a ſufficiency <hi>(ad poſſe credendum,)</hi> but a ſufficiency <hi>(ad actu credendum.)</hi> Now to this the actuall revelation of Chriſt is neceſſary, and to this actuall reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the actuall improvement of naturals is rquiſite (according to the courſe of providence, as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> deſcribeth it) what more roundly follows then this, That thoſe that do not actually improve naturals regularly, have not a ſufficiency to believe in Chriſt, becauſe ſuch have not the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, for if they had, the ſtanding courſe of providence is alſo broken? and now there is a fair way thus to argue,
<q>
                  <p>If no man doth actually improve naturals regularly, then all men have not ſufficiency of means for believing on Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But the former is true: Therefore the latter. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved by <hi>Rom. 3.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So that except Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> can prove that all men do actually improve naturall abilities, and ſo do that, upon which thoſe things that are requiſite to the believing on Chriſt, are granted, he hath not yet, no nor ever can prove that all men have a ſufficient means to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, if he will but adhere to the rules of his own pretended courſe of providence. And now to cloſe up all, until Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> can prove that every man can improve naturall abilities well, or can pleaſe God well by ſo doing, and that there is ſuch a ſtanding courſe of providence, as he pretendeth, and that upon the grant of all theſe all men may be ſaid to be in a ſufficiency of means for believing in Chriſt; until theſe be done. I hope, I may ſay, I have beat him from his ſecond ſtrong-hold, by which he expecteth to fortifie his doctrine of univerſall ſufficiency for faith in Chriſt: and that he ſuſpects the ſafety of this plea, I am induced to think, becauſe I finde him caſting about for a third reſerve, and to recede a little further, which maketh up a third part of his Treatiſe, and it is thus as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[Suppoſe we yet further for arguments ſake, that the Heathen want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the letter and externall adminiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I hope Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> intends not his Treatiſe to be like thoſe flying lying Phamphlets that beſpeak bloody fights in the title-page, but not ſo much as a ſlight skirmiſh in the body of them; in his title-page he telleth us of a ſufficiency to believe in Chriſt, and now he is ſunk ſo low, as to a remote capacity; doth he think that he dealeth with ſuch adverſaries as hold that the Heathen are not in a remote ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of believing in Chriſt? whom hath he yet ever known to hold ſo? Let Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> enjoy his remote capacity, and what will it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail him in the argument about which all their invented methods of univerſal ſufficient grace are formed? our Argument is this, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it not conſonant to the wiſdome of the Father and Chriſt to provide a way to procure life &amp; ſalvation for all men, and that ſuch a way as the blood of his only Son, and Chriſts own blood, and this price to be actually and compleatly paid; and ſo the purchaſe fully and actually to be made, and that out of a reall deſire and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſave them eternally, as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> and the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants grant, and yet that God ſhould not uſe ſome proportionable meanes that they might according to this purchaſe have life and ſalvation applyed, this is that which is the obſtruction that hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our concentring with Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in his doctrine of univerſal redemption; now if he ſhall ſatisfie us, &amp; ſolve the ſcruple by ſaying, he bringeth all men into a remote capacity of believing, the buſineſs remaineth as much involved as before; for what proportion is there betwixt in actuall and full purchaſe, and a remote capacity to that on which the application depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds? or what probability is there that Chriſt would by his blood actually purchaſe, and yet leave them but in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote capacity <hi>(yea, ſuch as is never likely to be reduced to act, as I ſhall preſently ſhew)</hi> of the application?</p>
            <p>But to conſider this remote capacity, that is his laſt refuge <hi>[It is ſuch as any nation hath of receiving thoſe commodities that are export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able out of another Nation, and to be had upon equitable addreſſes to them.]</hi> Let us proceed upon the right ſtating of this inſtance, and I will tranſmit it to the judgement of the wiſe: we muſt conſider a Nation altogether ignorant of the merchandize of another country, and in no probability of hearing thereof by any means by which they may be moved to make equitable addreſſes to that Nation, what capacity is that people in to partake of ſuch commodities? it muſt certainly be <hi>(Potentia remotiſſima)</hi> the moſt remote capacity that can be, which indeed is juſt nothing; the caſe is juſt alike; for Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:118748:61"/>
that they want the orall preaching of the Goſpel, and are not in any capacity of comming to the knowledg of it by the creature or providence, or by improvement of naturall abilities; that is, of having it diſcovered in any kind or other, yet theſe Heathen muſt have a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of being partakers of the orall adminiſtration of the Goſpel, becauſe they may by equitable addreſſes to theſe places, in which the Goſpel is preached, come to know: but where lyeth the capacity of theſe addreſſes, ſo long as they are ignorant of it, nor yet in a capacity to come to know it by any means?</p>
            <p>He ſeemeth to drive on this deſigne in <hi>Pag.</hi> 23, to 29 and I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, clearing it thus, Thoſe addreſſes may be made, becauſe God places his oracles amongſt the Jews, for that end, that they might by them be made known to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> &amp; therefore probably would ſo order, it that they ſhould come to hear of them, that they might come to make addreſſes to them for them, for I finde him thus ſpeaking:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[God diſcovered his gracious counſels in Jeſus Chriſt, under types &amp; ſhadows to the Jews, not that it was any part of his minde that theſe diſcoveries, or the great bleſſings thereby accruing unto men, ſhould be confined to this people; but that all the world and all Nations round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, might (if they pleaſed) have part in that fellowſhip, as many had who became Proſelytes.]</hi> Now if he could but half as eaſily prove as aſſert, he would drive on an unexpected work.

The holy Apoſtles were not ſo well nurtured and ſchooled in the fellowſhip of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.7, 8, 9.</note> as Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> they wondred that the Goſpel ſhould be preached, and repentance to life ſhould be granted to the <hi>Gentiles:</hi>

confined to the <hi>Jews</hi> for a time, why doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>(The fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Gentiles was bid in God, from the beginning of the world,)</hi> and but now made manifeſt; if it was no part of Gods mind, but that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould have part in that fellowſhip?

How could Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> pitch his thoughts on ſuch an <hi>Anomalous</hi> aſſertion as this, as if he did purpoſely endeavour to levell and deſtroy the whole method of the ſacred Scripture at once? But he ſeemeth to pretend a piece of Reaſon, and that from the law of the Proſelytes. How narrowly hath he conſulted with the Remonſtrants in this caſe? For thus we finde them reaſoning: [<note n="*" place="margin">Neque un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Gentiles à communione Iſraelis abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè excluſiſſe, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut patet ex le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus latis à Deo in cauſâ Proſelytarum. <hi>Hag.

               <hi>The Gentiles were never excluded from the communion of Iſrael abſolutely, as appeareth by thoſe laws that are given by God concerning Proſelytes.</hi>] But I conceive, that in this caſe, their reaſon fails them much; for what needed men become Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes to the <hi>Jews,</hi> if that as <hi>Gentiles</hi> they were to have a fellowſhip in the Goſpel, and that by the appointment of God? and that the <hi>Jews</hi> were betruſted with the Oracles of God, that they might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might challenge them as their due without becomming Proſelytes to the <hi>Jews;</hi> and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is valid againſt them: For if they were not to have any fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the <hi>Jews</hi> in the things of God, until they became Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes to the <hi>Jews,</hi> then it roundly followeth that they were not to have any part in that fellowſhip as <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for in having it as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes that had it not as <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but as <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He further ſaith alſo, that <hi>[the Moſaical and Ceremonial rites were of God delivered to the</hi> Jews <hi>by</hi> Moſes, <hi>for the training and nurturing up of the world in the knowledge of God, and the things of their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall peace.]</hi> Which ſeemeth ſtrange to me, that the Lord ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the training up of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by thoſe <hi>Moſaicall</hi> rites, when he never intended the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſhould be brought under that yoke of Judaiſme. How can he prove that God intended that the world ſhould be trained up in the knowledge of God,<note place="margin">Deut. 14.21.</note> when the Nations and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not to obſerve thoſe rites, as God ſaith of thoſe unclean meats forbidden to the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet they might give it to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and ſell it unto aliens, and they might eat of them; and in many places we might ſhew that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not tied to obſerve thoſe rites, and ſo could not by them to be nurtured up in the knowledge of God.</p>
            <p>But he ſeemeth to be carried on with vigour in this, meerely by the impulſe of one Scripture wherein <hi>Moſaicall</hi> rites are called <gap reason="foreign">

ſhould not ſtay and reſt in them, being imperfect like the world, and neglect Chriſt, in whom they might be compleat; but, as Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> gloſſes upon the words, where is the pertinency of the Apoſtles argument? it is no motive to them to relinquiſh thoſe beggarly rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if by <hi>(elements of the world)</hi> he mean ſuch as were given to the world, to train the Heathen up in the knowledge of God; for they might ſay, Doſt thou, <hi>Paul,</hi> reprove us <hi>Gentiles</hi> for adhering to theſe rudiments? are they not our own? and given to us to nurture us up in the knowledge of God; and therefore called the <hi>(elements of the world?)</hi> this would rather move them to adhere to them then relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh them.</p>
            <p>Many other occurrent expreſſes I find in this part of his treatiſe, which I ſhould not paſs, did not I fear being too voluminous; but much time and paper is taken up in proving that God hath done much for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in this caſe; but all that diſcourſe is very impertinent to that main queſtion which he firſt propounded, <hi>viz. (that thoſe are bound to believe, that never enjoyed the letter of the Goſpel).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that I have to ſome ſatisfaction to my ſelfe anotomized theſe three ſtrong-holds, to which he flyes to ſecure himſelfe againſt all aſſaults of Scripture and reaſon, and have ſo taken them to pieces, that they appear not in any capacity of defending his confident aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and notwithſtanding all which he ſaith, it doth not yet appeare that thoſe Heathen that never heard of Jeſus Chriſt, are in any rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal capacity, much leſſe in a mediate ſufficiency, leaſt of all in on immediate ſufficiency of believing in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But ſhould I grant him all that he hath attempted to prove, yet would it not hit his intended mark. I wonder that Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> ſo devoted to the rules of exquiſite diſpute, ſhould ſpend the bigger half of his Treatiſe, &amp; never conclude with his queſtion. In his Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpice he promiſed to ſhew us, how farre thoſe that never heard of Jeſus Chriſt are ye <hi>bound,</hi> to believe in Chriſt; but in all that part of his Book,<note n="(*)" place="margin">Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ad creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum non eſt ex lege, ſed ex E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelio; ex eo putà verbo, quo Chriſtus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponitur, quia ex eo praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ut in eo credamus. <hi>Corvin. in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. c.</hi> 11. §. 7.</note> which I have examined, he only proves that they are in a remote capacity, at the higheſt but a ſufficiency, but this comes ſhort of an obligation or being bound; we are not alwayes obliged to thoſe things to do which we are ſufficiently enabled; all obligation comes from a command; no man is obliged without ſome ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand as that, <hi>(Repent &amp; believe the Goſpel)</hi> this the Remonſtrants give us for granted. <hi>Corvinus</hi> ſaith thus: [<hi>The Obligation to believe in Chriſt, is not from the Law, but from the Goſpel, namely by that word in which Christ is propounded, becauſe in that word we are commanded to believe in him:</hi> but I need not urge them, Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> owne teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is ſtrong enough in this caſe; for he ſaith in his Poſtſcript thus: <hi>[Adam was under no obligation to repent, as is evident, becauſe there was no Poſitive Law given to him, or anything of that import, during that time;]</hi> now if this be a good argunent which Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth. <hi>(viz)</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> was not bound to repent, becauſe there was
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118748:63"/>
no Law given to bind him to repent, it is grounded upon this truth, that there is no obligation to any thing without a command.</p>
            <p>Now indeed in the following part of his Treatiſe he addreſſeth himſelf very handſomely to prove that all are bound to believe; but it is not without much provocation from his adverſary, and it is not till much labour hath been ſpent, as if he intended to let the world ſee that it is one of the laſt things he intendeth, to be pertinent.</p>
            <p>It is urged againſt him by an unknown Adverſary, thus: All men are not bound to believe, without the letter of the Goſpel, by which men are obliged and bound to believe, which argument is firm and good, and makes him caſt about for an univerſal obligation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, without the letter of the Goſpel, and he affirms, that all men are bound to believe on Chriſt by a double law; Firſt, by the Law of Nature. Secondly, by the Poſitive Law of God. I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine both in their order.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to examine whether all men by the Law of Nature be bound to believe on Chriſt: He layeth down his method thus: <hi>[Nature requireth of men,</hi> 1 <hi>That they ſeek after God, that is, the knowledge of his attributes, and perfection of his being.</hi> 2 <hi>After the best and richeſt diſcoveries of his will, where they are to be found.</hi> 3 <hi>To ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to every part of that will and pleaſure being made known.]</hi> And then, as the accompliſhment of his invention, he ſaith, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is the richeſt diſcovery of his will, and they are bound to ſubject themſelves unto it. But though I grant all theſe things, yet thus I anſwer, There is no obligation to believe on Chriſt yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant except the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tter of the Goſpell come, and then the true ſtate of the queſtion is deſtroyed; true it is, the Goſpel is the richeſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his mind and will, but how is this made knowne to them that never come to enjoy the letter of the Goſpel? I further argue thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Adam</hi> in innocencie was bound to do all theſe, to ſeek and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uire after God and the richeſt treaſure of his will, &amp;c. but I hope he will not ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> was bound to believe in innocency; if he do, it is not without the poſitive diſſent of the beſt of his ſide.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is ſtrange to ſee the ways of theſe men, to aſſume that to themſelves as Orthodox, what they explode in others as vaine and impertinent; when <hi>Molin</hi> urged thus upon the queſtion, whether <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had power to believe <hi>[the law commands us to aſſent to, and obey what ever the Lord ſaith or commandeth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Corvin. in. in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. cap. <hi>11. § 7.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>then it muſt follow that if Chriſt was propounded and preached, by the ſame law he ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to ſtand bound to believe the Goſpel;]</hi> this reaſoning is rejected by <hi>Corvinus</hi> as vain, and impertinent, but is not Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> the very ſame?</p>
            <p n="3">3 He ſaith, nature binds to obey the diſcoveries of his will being known; true, but then being unknown, no obligation to believe; then it muſt be enquired into, how men that never he the letter of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118748:64"/>
the Goſpel can come to the knowledge of the mind of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith in Chriſt. Still here is little proof, but meer trifeling.</p>
            <p>Now ſuch an aſſertion as this his adverſary lays upon him <hi>(That the light of nature cannot diſcover that ever there was ſuch a man or Mediator as Chriſt Jeſus;)</hi> but he is pleaſed to ſay that it is not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to our purpoſe, but I think very much. For let this be granted, then I urge, though the law of nature bind us to do all the three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named particulars, yet it doth not oblige us to believe in Chriſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the light of nature cannot diſcover Chriſt; and if not, how can it oblige men to believe on Chriſt I ſee not, becauſe according to himſelf it bindes men to obey no further then is known; but he ſaith further thus: <hi>[Though it be not ſufficient to diſcover Chriſt, yet it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to teach them that it is their duty to inquire after the beſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his will, and being known it can tell them it is their duty to believe in Chriſt,]</hi> how he hath loſt himſelf on his own circle? true, it may teach them to inquire, but how to believe on Chriſt I ſee not, becauſe they are not bound to obey, further then it is known: and nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcover Chriſt, nor any way left for knowing him otherwiſe. For the queſtion ſuppoſeth them not to have the letter of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He is much miſtaken, the law of nature <hi>(upon that ſuppoſition that faith in Chriſt was diſcovered,)</hi> could not be ſaid to be the dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of that duty, but the poſitive law that is newly diſcovered; nature commandeth general obedience, being a general law, but a ſpecial law muſt be the ground of a ſpecial obedience: if he conſult with <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus</hi> he will grant this to paſs for good divinity, as I may illuſtrate it by this inſtance:</p>
            <p>The Law of nature bindeth me to obey my Superiors and ſo us all, this is a general law; but as a ground of ſpecial obedience there is required a law poſitive, that I may know wherein to obey them; as to ſay, Our Superiours for Politique ends forbid us to eat fleſh in Lent, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hall he hence conclude that it is a dictate of nature not to eat fleſh in Lent? then it is againſt the law of nature to eat fleſh in Lent, but who can underſtand this? therefore we muſt neceſſarily diſtinguiſt, thus, nature bindeth us to obey, but their Poſitive law to obey in this or that particularity; neither could the law of nature ever dictate to any man that he is bound not to eat fleſh in Lent, the caſe is much a like, the law of nature binds us to obey God as our Maker, but the law poſitive comes and bids us to obey him in believing Chriſt: This obligation as it is particularized comes from the Poſitive law of God, not from the law of nature; for the law of nature could never dict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſuch a particularity of obedience, as to beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt. And thus farre I can improve the ſmile he preduceth in <hi>Pag.</hi> 31, 32. but how farre further it tendeth I ſee not: for it vaniſheth into ſmoak if we conſider that the legiſlative power in any nation or kingdom doth not confine the diſcovery of their lawes to the Metropolis, but as for thoſe Laws by which mens daily and weekly tranſactions are to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118748:64"/>
be guided, they take ſuch courſe that they ſhall be publiſhed at the Market-towns of every Shire or County where it is to be ſuppoſed, that all reſpectively are led by their occaſions; or in a Seſſions quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, Juſtices of the Peace are in their charges to acquaint them with all thoſe Penal Statutes, and other Lawes requiſite to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating of our lives, which he can no ways prove God doth by the Goſpel in any proportionable diſcovery.</p>
            <p>But he undertaketh to prove by a twofold Argument, that nature bindeth all men to believe on Chriſt; if reduced to form, it would run thus:
<q>(If nature binds us to uſe the beſt means for our welfare and peace, then it binds us to believe, it being the only way to life:</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But nature bindeth all men to uſe the beſt meant for their welfare: Therefore, &amp;c.)</hi> The Argument is plauſible enough, if he had not himſelf laid the ground of its confutation, the ſame notions will anſwer it that I gave before: nature teacheth no man to uſe any means for his welfare, but what he knoweth to be in ſuch a tendency; but the queſtion preſuppoſeth that they do not yet know, and when they come to know, true then they are bound to obſerve it, but the ſtate of the queſtion is altered.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Argument which he uſeth is deduced from <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. where the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>(There is no name under Heaven by which a man can be ſaved but Ieſus Chriſt,)</hi> but how the Argument muſt be formed or where the ſtrength of it lyeth, he puts us to the labour to ſeek it out. He ſaith, that this text croſſeth two main Pillars of his Adverſaries doctrine, the firſt I own with a little correction, thus: [<hi>That the law of Salvation,</hi> viz. (He that believeth ſhall be ſaved) <hi>reſpecteth thoſe that are Evangelized onely, that is, ſuch as have the diſcovery of the Goſpel by ſome way and means, beyond and above the light of nature.</hi>] So that this be underſtood of Adults; for as for Infants, how God dealeth with them, whether they be ſaved by faith, or whoſe faith, or what faith, or how; I leave it to Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to determine. Let him underſtand me thus, and then I challenge him to prove how that text, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. overthroweth this; it ſeemeth Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> thinketh that this Law of Salvation (as he calleth it) <hi>(He that believeth ſhall be ſaved)</hi> doth not reſpect men Evangelized onely, I know not what ſophiſtical ſenſe he may retein of thoſe words <hi>(doth not reſpect)</hi> he may know that the point in hand is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout obligation to believe, ſo that he ought to have expreſt it thus; That Law of Salvation reſpecteth not onely men Evangelized as a bond or obligation to believe; but thus it is very liable to ſcruple: for this Law of Salvation, as he calleth it <hi>(He that beleeveth ſhall be ſaved)</hi> muſt be conſidered as conceived in God onely in his minde, and purpoſe, whereby as the Remonſtrants ſay he did <hi>(certam rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem ſtatuere)</hi> appoint a certain way by which he would ſave men; and thus conſidered it is not to come under the notion of an obliging
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:118748:65"/>
principle, becauſe thus it is hidden in God, and ſo nothing to us. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is conſiderable as diſcovered and pronounced to the world, whereby the Lord acquainteth us with his gracious award concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us; and thus will Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſay, that it reſpects not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Evangelized, when the very diſcovery of this to us is Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, and the diſcovery of the Goſpel; and it becomes an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to none but them that have it diſcovered to them. But in his next I expect that he produce his argument in form, that I may know what he intendeth, and I ſhall return anſwer.</p>
            <p>But he proceeds in his magnificates of the light of nature thus: <hi>[My principles will not allow we to gratifie you with my bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>efe of your poſition, which is, that the light of nature cannot diſcover to mankinde that there was or ever would be ſuch a Mediatour or man as Jeſus Chriſt.]</hi> What principles they are which thus obſtruct his faith, or belief of the truths of God, are beſt known to himſelf, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſaving truth will tell us, that we may read of a naturall Theology, but of a naturall Chriſtianity no where. This is revealed by a new way; hence the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtumbled at it, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> derided it as inconſiſtent with their Philoſophicall and naturall principles; the World by their wiſedome knew not God, how then can the light of Nature diſcover a Chriſt? it is not by wiſdome of the world, but the fooliſhneſs of preaching that he ſaveth men, and that the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by men, not the heavens; for this laſt preaching involves the wiſdome of the world.</p>
            <p>But becauſe he will leave no ſtone unturned, he by way of conceſſion, thus ſaith: <hi>[Suppoſe it cannot diſcover a Chriſt in ſuch particularities as now under the Goſpel, yet it cannot be denied but that it may ſo far diſcover him, as that a man may be rationally perſwaded through him to depend upon God for the pardon of his ſins and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.]</hi> But this is meer trifeling, for we ſay, that the light of Nature alone is unable not onely to diſcover a Chriſt in particularities, but at all, and upon that ground no man can be perſwaded to depend upon God through him; for thus, ſuppoſe that a man know that Chriſt is, it is ſtrange that he ſhould recede from the firſt poſition; and ſuppoſe that the light of nature did not and could not diſcover that ſuch a man as Chriſt ever was, and yet to ſuppoſe that by the light of nature a man may be perſwaded to depend upon God for life through Chriſt: but he attempteth to prove, that the light of nature doth diſcover ſo much, as that men may be ſo rationally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to depend on God through Chriſt for life; and this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by two Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His firſt Argument is from the Jews, who he ſaith, <hi>[The ſum of what they believed concerning Chriſt was this, that God had found out a way, and pleaſed himſelf in a means how to ſhew mercy and forgive ſins, and ſave their ſouls that put their truſt in him, and live righteouſly, yet they believed to ſalvation, though Chriſt not diſcovered to them in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:118748:65"/>
ſuch particularities as now;]</hi> wherein he doth egregiouſly prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; for,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That which he is to prove was this, that men by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can ſo farre diſcover Chriſt, as that they are rationally perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to depend on God for ſalvation through Chriſt: but in all this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract which he produceth, what ſyllable is it that gives the leaſt hint of Chriſt? It is only thus, (that they beleeved that God pleaſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a way, and means to ſhew mercy, forgive ſin, to ſave the ſoules of them that truſt in him and live righteouſly) now let the World judge, whether any or all of theſe do infer a dependance upon God for life through Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Suppoſe it did ſo, what pertinency hath this inſtance to the caſe in hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He inſtanceth in the Jews, who had the written Word or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſcoveries of Chriſt proportionable to their faith in Chriſt, a generall and indiſtinct knowledge of Chriſt being every way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to a generall and indiſtinct faith; Now ſuppoſe they had a generall and indiſtinct faith in Chriſt, yet if this faith came by a generall and indiſtinct diſcoveries, either by written Word or vocal diſpenſation, then this inſtance is very vainly produced to prove that the light of nature without other diſcovery can diſcover Chriſt in particularities or in general.</p>
            <p n="2">2 His ſecond Argument by which he proveth it is this, and it is by the complication of three Propoſitions thus:</p>
            <p>[<hi>Jeſus Chriſt is in ſuch a faith, wherby men are enabled to come to God with acceptance,</hi> John <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>whereby a man believeth that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, he is enabled to come to God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. <hi>and further, the Heathen by the light of nature, without the advantage of the Goſpel, may come to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him;]</hi> by which he proveth that a Heathen meerly by the law and light of nature may diſcover Chriſt ſo as that by him he may come to God with acceptance; and a very plauſible plea it were, if it did not favour too much of the windings of the ſubtile ſerpent. I ſhall conſider them in order apart, and then leave them to Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to improve joyntly and together,</p>
            <p n="1">1) His firſt Propoſition is, <hi>[That Christ is in that faith whereby men are enabled to come to God with acceptance;]</hi> this I aſſert for a truth, but all together contradictious and inconſiſtent with the words of the Remonſtrants and Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> himſelf; it is ſon thing remarkable to conſider that when he would magnifie the light of nature by making it to run parallel with that which the Jews enjoyed, he then reduced the object of faith to a low ſcantling; and in the Page immediately foregoing, affirmed that the Jewes believed to ſalvation, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved nothing but this, <hi>[that God had pleaſed himſelfe with a way &amp; meanes of mercy and ſaving men that truſt in him and live righteouſly;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 36.</note>] where is there the leaſt intimation of Jeſus Chriſt in all that and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:118748:66"/>
yet they believed to ſalvation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 37, 38.</note> and therefore came to God with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance; and again ſpeaking of the faith of the Jews of old, he ſaith, <hi>[That they did not believe on Chriſt (except interpretatively and virtually) but only expreſly in God, and yet none could deny but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to ſalvation,]</hi> but now needs muſt Chriſt be in ſuch a faith; without any ſuch limitation and reſtriction, as (interpretatively or virtually); and how is it averred, and that both from reaſon and Scripture, as the Remonſtrants pretend, that faith in Jeſus Chriſt was never exacted, nor performed by the Fathers under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament?</p>
            <p n="2">2 His ſecond Propoſitition is this: [<hi>That by ſuch a faith, whereby a man believeth that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, a man is enabled to come to God,</hi> Heb. 11.6.] which propoſition is falſe, and by it he ſuborneth a text for his cauſe, that text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. ſaith indeed that <hi>he that commeth to God must believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder of thim that ſeek him,</hi> but it ſaith nor, neither will it follow, that all that believe thoſe things are enabled to come with acceptance; the Devils in hell and many reprobates may and do believe theſe, and yet they are not enabled to come to God with acceptance; I wonder that any man of that way, who, to that text, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. <hi>(No man comes except my Father draw him;)</hi> ſay, that it doth not follow, therefore that all that he draws do come, ſhould thus prevaricate for their own ends in this text.</p>
            <p n="3">3 His third Propoſition is this: <hi>[That every man by the light of nature can come to know that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him;]</hi> which I do not only bring into queſtion, but do affirm alſo to be falſe; true indeed if we ſpeak in generall terms, by the light of nature a man may diſcover that God is, and that he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder, &amp;c. but if we make a particular application to man in his corrupt eſtate, then I ſay that no man without the letter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell can come to know this; the Law concludeth us all under an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall curſe, now who can know or what way is extant to believe a reward upon any termes, but by the Goſpell and more then nature can diſcover? So that taking this ſhort ſurvey of the Propoſitions apart, if any pleaſe let him put them together, and judge what ſolid argument for the truth can be drawn out of one inconſiſtencie and two falſities, and if this my anſwer pleaſe him nor, let him in his next bring them into better form of arguing, and I ſhall ſay more; it is as methodicall an anſwer as I thought good to give to ſuch a confuſed and indigeſted argument. And now I have ſeen the ſtrength of his arguments whereby he hath attempted to prove that the light of nature doth oblige a man to believe, I ſhall urge one or two to prove that the law of nature neither doth nor can, and thus I urge:
<q>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>1</label> If <hi>Adam</hi> before ſuch time as the promiſe was given, was under nor ſuch obligation as to repent and ſo to believe, then the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not, can not binde men to repent and believe in Chriſt: But the former is true: Therefore the latter is true alſo.</q>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:118748:66"/>
The Propoſition of this Argument is grounded upon this, that <hi>Adam</hi> had the law of nature, and more quick-ſighted into the creatures and common providence of God, then any of his poſterity: and he equally bound to take the beſt courſe for his own welfare; and yet he was not bound to repent and believe; then certainly his poſterity are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by the meer light of Nature: I deſire ſome proof why the fame Light and Law of Nature, that was no bond or obligation to <hi>Adam,</hi> could be ſo to his poſterity. If <hi>Adam</hi> had the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet was not bound to believe or repent, it was either,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe he could not diſcover ſuch a thing as ſatisfaction, or a Mediatour, or Chriſt; he ſaw only a reprieve, no pardon or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: and if thus, how can his poſterity meerly by the Law and light of Natur diſcover a Saviour?</p>
            <p n="2">2 Or elſe if he did diſcover, then it was becauſe he had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to believe or repent, as he intimateth in his Poſtſcript, becauſe the obligation dependeth upon a command; and if ſo, then how can they who never had the letter of the Goſpel, be ſaid to be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to believe and repent? Thus the <hi>Major</hi> is ſtrengthened.</p>

            <q>If men cannot here believe without hearing, nor heare without preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor preach without ſending, then men cannot believe without a further diſcovery of the Goſpel, then what the light of Nature affordeth:</q>

               <hi>But the former is true, Rom.</hi> 10.14.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14,</note> I chuſe this argument founded upon this text, becauſe Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſeeks to temper and take off the edge of this text. Now I hope he will not ſay, that this hearing and preaching is by the heavens; for then the heavens muſt be ſent by God to preach in order to faith, but how will he prove that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but thus he anſwereth to this text and Argument,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 32.</note> in the 32 Page of this Treatiſe: <hi>[The meaning of theſe Interrogatories is not as if no man could poſſibly believe the Goſpel, but he that heard it perſonally preached by a Miniſter, but implyeth theſe three things.</hi> 1 <hi>That man having cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted himſelf, was in no probability to believe on God by Jeſus Chriſt, without the advantage of ſome report of the Goſpel made in one kinde or other.</hi> 2 <hi>That there was no likelihood to hear of God or of Chriſt in the Gospel, had there not been ſome one or more to have preached the Goſpel in the world.</hi> 3 <hi>It was not likely that any man or men ſhould or would have preacht the Goſpel, had they not been ſent and received inſtructions concerning the publiſhing of it.</hi>] In which anſwers,</p>
            <p n="1">1 He prevaricateth and halteth manifeſtly; for his firſt particular comes far ſhort of truth, as he intendeth it, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is any part of the Apoſtles meaning, to affirm that we could not believe without Chriſt was diſcovered in the Goſpel by ſome way, and in one kinde or other; as if he purpoſely left ſuch a latitude, as that he might take in the light of nature, as one kinde of diſcovery of Chriſt ſufficient for faith, which is evidently falſe, for that hearing without which he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:118748:67"/>
ſaith, we cannot believe, is confined to the hearing the letter of the Goſpel, which men are ſent by commiſsion to preach, and that to beget faith, and in that Apoſtolical Induction the laſt, and the firſt have as ſtrong a dependance as any two: and it is as true that no man can believe except ſome be ſent, as this, No man can believe except he hear.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But I deſire no more then he gives, for ſolution to confirm us, he granteth three things. 1 That none can believe without the report of the Goſpel, in one kinde or other. 2 That we are not likely to heare of Chriſt in the Goſpel, without ſome preach. 3 That it is not likely that any ſhould preach, except they be by Commiſſions and Inſtructions ſent. Now what need we more then this, to confirm us, that men cannot, nor are bound to believe meerly by the light of Nature, without ſome further diſcovery thereof in the Goſpel? Thus I have traverſed all Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> ſteps, and yet it appeareth not that man is either enabled or bound to believe in Chriſt meerly by the law and light of Nature; and yet having done with the law of Nature, he proceeds further to ſay,</p>
            <p>That all men are bound to believe on Jeſus Chriſt by the Poſitive law of God, and this he doth in Page the 44th. and he gives two Scriptures to prove it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 44. Pſal. 2.12. 1 Joh. 3.23.</note> Pſal. 2.12. (<hi>Kiſs the Son. Be wiſe, O ye Judges of the earth.</hi> And, 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>This is the commandement that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on his Son Jeſus Chriſt.)</hi> From theſe Scriptures he would prove that all men without exception are bound to believe on Jeſus Chriſt by the Poſitive law of God; but to this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1) How impertinent is all this to his purpoſe if he could prove it to be truth? that which he is to prove, is that even thoſe that never heard of the letter of the Goſpel, and ſo by conſequence, not of the commands thereof, that thoſe are bound to believe; and now he proves that all are bound by a Poſitive law, that is in effect thus, that thoſe that never heard of the letter of the Goſpel, have yet a Poſitive law to bind them to believe; it ſeemes he doth not ſo well conſider as he might, that for any man to have ſuch a Poſitive law, is to have the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p n="2">2) I hope henceforth the Remonſtrants will never ſay, that faith in Jeſus Chriſt was never commanded to our fathers of old under the time of the Law; Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> will teach them better Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and tell them they were all commanded to it by a Poſitive law.</p>
            <p n="3">3) Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> himſelfe affirmeth that the faith that was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Jews to juſtification under the Law <hi>[had Chriſt in it only virtually, and interpretatively, and explicitely none but God himſelfe, and therefore God would accept ſuch a faith much more in the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles]</hi> Pag. 38.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 38.</note> and yet now they were all commanded by a Poſitive law to believe in Chriſt; I hope Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> will reconcile all theſe together.</p>
            <p n="4">4) But to examine the truth of his aſſertion, whether that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:118748:67"/>
was a ſufficient obligation to all men to believe; how will Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> prove that this was any obligation to any man untill it be revealed to them? Let that ſtand which <hi>Muſculus</hi> ſaith upon the text <hi>(Quiſnam mortalium ab hâc ſubmiſſione excipitur cùm ipſis regibus imponitur?)</hi> true, no man is exempted from this ſubmiſſion, when this command ſhall come greeting; yet not obliged until they heare the command.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> drives on theſe general commands thus far; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1 Joh. 3.23. he ſaith thus, <hi>[he cannot be conceived only to ſpeake to Saints or ſuch who are believers already, as if theſe were the men whom God commands to believe in the Name of his Son; for then it will follow that thoſe that did believe before the command did ſupererogate; nor can it be meant of them only who have the letter of the Goſpell for then ſuch as believe without the letter thereof, do alſo ſupererogate; and therefore it muſt not be underſtood, we Saints, or we that have the letter of the Goſpel, but we men;]</hi> wherein Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> layeth many feeble ſnares as eaſily broken as ſpiders webbes.</p>
            <p n="1">1 By the face of his expreſſions I find that he ſuppoſeth it irrational, that this or any command ſhould be given or aſſerted to any that do already believe; but many expreſſes of Scripure will reſcue ſuch a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice from al the charges of impropriety, had he not ſo much time or lea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure to look upon the foregoing verſe, where he ſaith, <hi>We receive what we ask, becauſe we keep his commandement,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 3.22, 23</note> 
               <hi>and this is the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we believe in his Son,</hi>] and yet in his divinity it muſt not be we Saints, or we that have the Goſpel, but we men, as if it might be ſaid of all men, that <hi>(we keep the commandement;)</hi> in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.12, 13, 14, 15. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I write, to you fathers, young men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.12, 13, 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe ye have known him from the beginning, and are ſtrong, &amp; the Word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one; Love not the world, neither the things that are of the world,</hi> muſt we reaſon thus? he writes not to thoſe that love not the world already, for otherwiſe, they obſerving that piece of Chriſtian practice before this writing to them, did ſupererrogate; and if this inſtance pleaſe him not, let us ſee a little further. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.13. <hi>(I have written to you that believe on the Name of the Son of God,</hi>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:118748:68"/>
actually believe, and ſo by conſequence, this text doth not furniſh us with any poſitive law, whereby all men without exception, are bound to believe on Chriſt,</p>
            <p n="2">2 This method of reaſoning ſuppoſeth that ſome may come to believe, and yet not hear of the letter of the Goſpel (that is) having only the light of nature; but he knows that <hi>(ſuppoſitio nihil ponit)</hi> he may ſuppoſe by the help of his compounding and dividing fancy, golden mountains and ſtrange <hi>Chymaera's;</hi> but this ſuppoſition, ſaith he, is not unſound, becauſe it hath been proved ſufficiently, that thoſe that have not the letter of the Goſpel are yet in a capacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, but herein he muſt not play the Sophiſter with us, if he mean <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> that is, he that is now a Heathen and a <hi>Gentile</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all diſcovery of the Goſpel, may in time by change of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition come to believe in Chriſt. Thus he need not prove it, and if this hath been his task hitherto, he hath ſpent much time to little purpoſe, but if he mean <hi>(in ſenſu compoſito)</hi> that is, whileſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ſo without any farther diſcovery then what nature affords him, he is in no capacity of believing, and it is impoſſible he ſhould whileſt he ſo remaineth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How can they believe on him of whom they have not heard?</hi> Now if he mean this capacity, I think he neither hath, nor ever will prove, although it is the intended mark in all this his Treatiſe. But he gives a taſte of his Logick, to prove that it is not impoſſible ſuch a man ſhould believe, and it is this: <hi>(Poſſibile eſt quo poſito nihil ſequitur impoſſibile;)</hi> That is poſſible, upon which no impoſſibility followeth; but this, I conceive, fitteth him not handſomely, but rather the contrary: <hi>(Impoſſibile quo poſito, aliqua alia impoſſibilia:)</hi> that is, Impoſſibility ſuppoſeth all things impoſſible: for thus his own words direct us: <hi>[If their belief be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, then it includeth ſome other thing impoſſible alſo.]</hi> Yes, it do's ſo:<note place="margin">Quicquid eſt, dum eſt, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſariò eſt.</note> for take it <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> and two impoſſibilities follow. 1 That they ſhould ever know or hear of Chriſt, for <hi>(What ever is, whileſt, it is neceſſarily;)</hi> and it is impoſſible for any man to come to Chriſt whileſt he remaineth without all means to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him. 2 It is alſo impoſſible that they ſhould be ſaved. But this will not be well digeſted by Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and that upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he produceth it thus: <hi>[In caſe men deſtitute at preſent of the letter of the Goſpel ſhould not ſtand bound by ſome Law of God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, then in caſe the letter of the Goſpel ſhould afterward be vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to them, they muſt either be ſuppoſed to ſtand ſtill as much diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged from, believing as before, or elſe that there is ſome new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment impoſed, which was not impoſed on them before by God.]</hi> But may we not demand,</p>
            <p n="1">1 If they have the Command and Law of God already laid on them, obliging them to believe; what need they have a further Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Goſpel, as to the obligation to believe in Chriſt?</p>
            <p n="2">2 But to ſuppoſe that men ſhould not be bound by any Law, and yet come to have the letter of the Goſpel, it might fall out that they

ſhould neither have a new Command, nor yet remain diſobliged; I hope, he knoweth well to diſtinguiſh betwixt a new Command and a new Impoſition; for in thoſe expreſſes of his, <hi>[Or elſe there is ſome Commandement impoſed by God;]</hi> that word <hi>(new,)</hi> he may refer ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>(Commandement)</hi> or <hi>(Impoſition;)</hi> now the Commandement may be old, and yet the Impoſition new, ſo it may be new to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom it is at preſent impoſed; hence the Apoſtle calleth,<note place="margin">1 John 2.7, 8.</note>

            <p n="1">1 I know Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> will ſay again, that there was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to our fathers of old, to believe on Jeſus Chriſt expreſly in the particularities of his perſon, but we are now commanded to do ſo, and this I think is a new Command.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He urgeth thus, there is no new Law impoſed, <hi>[Becauſe in him there is not the leaſt ſhadow of change,]</hi> a very conſciencious plea, and I am glad to finde Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> thus tender of Gods Immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity if it come not <hi>(ex labi is doloſis)</hi> out of deceitful lips. It is uſuall with men of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> judgement to affirm God firſt willing to ſave all men by his antecedent will, but in regard of Infidelity interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to be reſolving to condemn thoſe men whom before he willed to ſave; and Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> himſelf, holds that a perſon whom God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth; may yet by God be reprobated, and this without the leaſt ſenſe and tenderneſs of his Immutability, when there is however e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, if not more cauſe. But, ſecondly, How doth this new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand impoſed on men, introduce a change into God? True indeed thoſe things that are in God cannot be changed (to which it behoves the <hi>Arminians</hi> to look;) but thoſe things that are without him, may without prejudice to him for God to entertain a change in his actions as to create and deſtroy the World, this agues no change in him;<note place="margin">

Adam</hi> had no obligation to repent and believe in the eſtate of his Integrity, nor after the fall until the promiſe, and that becauſe there was no law to binde, nor any thing of that import given to man; if Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> deny this he contradicts himſelf; if he grant it, he either introduceth upon God variableneſs and ſhadow of change, contrary to this text, or elſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth the weakneſs of his own Argument.</p>
            <p n="3">3 He urgeth, that it no new Law impoſed, becauſe <hi>(Affirmative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts binde always, but not to always.)</hi>

            <p>A third Scripture, by which he attempteth to prove that all men are bound to believe on Chriſt by a Poſitive Law,<note place="margin">Acts 17.30.</note> is out of <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. <hi>(Now he commandeth all men every where to repent.)</hi> but,</p>
            <p n="1">1 True, ſuppoſe all without exception were admoniſhed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; then, what became of all thoſe that lived in the time of that ignorance ſpoken of, wherein God ſuffered the Nations to walk in their own wayes without admoniſhing, and directing them how to walk, as he now doth in the Goſpel; as he ſaith in the 11th. page of his Treatiſe? Now I expect that he ſhew me the difference betwixt the admonitions before, and now, whether that before, was not orall by the Miniſtery of men, at it is now?</p>
            <p n="2">2 For this <hi>(all)</hi> he ſaith, it cannot be confined to ſuch perſons or places to which the Goſpel is actually ſent; (and that not with that honour and reverence that is due to the Scripture.) O how tender Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is of the honour of the Scriptures, where they (as he thinks) ſpeak of his ſide! but all is not truth that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaith, becauſe he ſaith it; how (I pray) doth it derogate from the honour of the Scripture, to interpetret <hi>(all men)</hi> in the text, by <hi>(all both Jews and Gentiles)</hi> where this word of admonition ſhall come?</p>
            <p n="3">3 The <hi>Antitheſis</hi> ſeems to carry it our way <hi>(but now he admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all men to repent;)</hi> it ſeems to infer that all men, that is, both Jew and Gentile, were not admoniſhed to repent; we urge not that there was no admonition to repent at all before, but not ſo large as at that time there was; that is, both to Jew and Gentile: the Apoſtles won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>that repentance to life ſhould be given, and preached to the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile; <hi>But now,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter, I know that of every Nation, he that worketh righteouſneſs is accepted;</hi> and that is one, and the ſame with this text in hand.

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 63.</note> this he is willing to grant in his diſpute with Mr. <hi>Sympſon;</hi> as for the ſecond, it reſts upon him to prove where God did admoniſh all men, even the Heathen, to repent in this way; this text doth not prove it, becauſe he granteth that God did not deal with the Heathen
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:118748:69"/>
as men under the Goſpel, which this text chiefly hinteth, which cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth that this text is weakly produced to prove, that all men, without exception, are bound by a poſitive Law to repent, becauſe this ſpeaks of ſuch an Admonition, as in his own judgment was not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to them whom he ſuffered to walk in their own wayes.</p>
            <p>But he would have this the ſenſe of the <hi>Antitheſis, [Not as if his diſpenſations were ſo different, as that under the one men were left free from all manner of comand to repent, and only under the other they ſhould ſtand charged with that duty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 51.</note> 
               <hi>but it importeth that the obligation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent under the former was faint and obſcure; and with little authority under the times of ignorance, in compariſon of that tie and obligation which God by an expreſs comand impoſeth upon the world under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; &amp; this import of the ſaid Antitheſis, appears by frequent uſage of Scriptures, and the condition of the Heathen throughout the world, before the times of the Goſpel.]</hi> What pains will a mans intereſt provoke him to, even to the infatuation of his own underſtanding in cleer texts? For</p>
            <p n="1">1 How fraudulently doth he proceed (on theſe words?) <hi>[As if he had left men without all command to repent before theſe times, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks) leaving the expreſſion ſo indefinite, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, as if we held that men were not under the Law commanded to repent.]</hi> When I grant it all along, and only deny that the Heathen were under ſuch a command, who enjoyed no more then the light of nature: and I may as juſtly deny this as he denies that <hi>Adam</hi> had no obligation to repent till the promiſe was given, becauſe there was no command, nor any thing of that import until that time.</p>
            <p n="2">2 How weakly and trivially doth he argue? he produceth this text, (as he affirmeth) to prove that an obligation lyeth upon all men (without exception) to repent; and when it commeth to the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; whether this text ſpeak of all men in all ages and times, or all where and when the Goſpel comes; inſtead of proving,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 54.</note> he anſwers and ſaith. <hi>[It doth not neceſſarily imply, that God never till now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſame thing.]</hi> But where is his proof? his proof cannot be fetcht from this phraſe, <hi>(He now admoniſheth all men)</hi> becauſe this is meant of the oral adminiſtration of the Goſpel, which he granteth all have not, and if he have any poſſibility of proving his doctrine by this text, it lies in that expreſſion, <hi>(The time of that ignorance God regardeth not;)</hi> and then let him form his thoughts into an argument, and it will be a miſerable one.</p>
            <p n="3">3 How contradictiouſly doth he proceed? his tenent to be proved, is, that all men without exception are obliged by a poſitive Law to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe; and he proves it by this text, the ſenſe whereof is this: <hi>[That the obligation to repent in former times was but faint and obſcure, and without authority, in compariſon to that obligation which God layeth upon the world to an expreſs command under the time of the Goſpel.]</hi> As if there were ſuch a difference betwixt an expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and a poſitive command; and now it ſeems, all men without exception, and all ages were obliged to repent by a poſitive Law-
<pb facs="tcp:118748:70"/>
and proved by this text, that ſheweth that the expreſs command to repent is given but now in the times of the Goſpel, and is not this handſomly proved? it ſeems that poſitive Law that breeds in all men to repent, is not an expreſs command.</p>
            <p n="4">4 How injuriouſly doth he proceed? injuriouſly to God himſelf, for he is to prove a poſitive Law of God by which man are bound to repent, and doth it by a Scripture, that ſheweth no command or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, but what is weak and faint and obſcure, and without autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in compariſon of that command in the Goſpel, as if that Law that is poſitively given by God, ſhould in its obligation be but weak, and faint, and obſcure, and without authority, in compariſon of that which is but poſitive; let him produce ſuch commands poſitive that are ſo weak, obſcure, and without authority; are not all the commands poſitive of God of equal Authority?</p>
            <p n="5">5 How ſlenderly is he backed with proof? he ſaith the obligation to repent in former times was but weak, and faint, and obſcure. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, ſo obſcure as that he cannot produce one Scripture to prove it, I ſhall be glad to ſee one Scripture, which cleerby evinceth any obligation at all, as lying on the Heathen that never had more then the light of nature,</p>
            <p n="6">6 For his Scriptures which he produceth to fortifie his tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this <hi>Antitheſis</hi> in the text, they are all of them impertinent, becauſe they have not any of them ſuch direct &amp; full terms of an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis</hi> in them, no not that text, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.44. which he alone produceth under the notion of an <hi>Antitheſis.</hi> For Chriſt doth not at all oppoſe his being preſent with them before, &amp; that after his Reſurrection, nor ſpeaks he any thing at all in that Verſe of his being then preſent, but barely telleth them that when he was with them, he told them that all things muſt be fulfilled, which were ſaid by <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the Prophets.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Whereas he ſaith, that his is the genuine ſenſe of the text from the condition of the world and all mankinde, under the times of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and before the dayes of the Goſpel, which was this, that the world was generally under the comand to repent; he here doth but beg the queſtion, and repeat what he had aſſerted before, and ſo proves nothing; for I ſay on the other hand, it is moſt clear they were not under any command to repent, but he proves by ſeveral expreſſions, which ſeem to carry the face of Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>[Then their impenitency and obduracy in ways contrary to the Law of God and Nature had been no ſin in them, nor obligatory to puniſhment.]</hi> But doth he think this any way coercive? I ſay, that their ſin commeth not under the notion of impenitency; again, that ſuch as have only the light of nature cannot be ſaid to have any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law of God. Thirdly, I alſo ſay, that the ſins of the Heathen (though they have no command to repent) are yet ſins againſt the law of nature, and they are a law to themſelves, and ſhall be judg'd by that law of nature, and ſo without any poſitive law, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, which helpeth us to underſtand the Apoſtle in that text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. <hi>The law worketh wrath;</hi> if we will take it thus generally, Every law worketh wrath proportionable to it ſelf, the law of nature
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:118748:70"/>
worketh wrath proportionable to it; the law of God poſitive, to it; the law of the Goſpel, to it; not that by every law men ſhall incur wrath for non-repentance, except Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> can prove that all men without exception are condemned for not repenting (as a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a command) which proof I demand: therefore that doth not affright me; for it is eaſily anſwered, although they be not under a command to repent, yet they are not therefore left lawleſs, and may commit and do what they liſt, without any guilt or puniſhment; this is fondly alledged, for the ſolution is eaſie, they have a law of nature, and are a law to themſelves, and ſo having a law they may ſin, and their conſciences ſhall condemn them, yea, and God ſhall condemn them alſo, theſe I know Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> could not but conſider; therefore how he could think of mens being lawleſs, or Gods not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king account of the Heathen for ſinning, although we do grant and prove it too, that the Heathen are under no obligation to repent, for that law may conclude us under ſin, that cannot command us repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for ſinning, the one is a priviledge of the law, the other of the Goſpel, which makes way for his ſecond Reaſon, which is this:</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe to all, even in the times before the Gospel, he gave ſo much means, that they might ſeek the Lord and finde him,</hi> Acts 17.26, 27. <hi>Therefore all men are under a command to repent.</hi> But this is far from binding; for we ſeek the Lord. 1 In obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, 2 In repentance for not obeying. <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity was bound to ſeek God, but not to repent; now that God doth ſo much for the Heathen that they might ſeek him in a way of obedience, and ſo far as to ſerve and worſhip him as the true God, I grant; but that God intendeth, that by that which God doth for every man, they ſhould ſeek him in a way of repentance, I put him to prove.</p>
            <p>Thus have I followed him ſtep by ſtep, and if I have run into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing and extravagant notions, I have this fair excuſe, that I was neceſſarily led thereinto, and I have conſidered and examined every parcel of his Treatiſe: and to cloſe up all, this is the reſult of all, <hi>All men are not bound by any Law Poſitive, or of nature to repent and believe: neither are all the Heathen in a capacity of believing, much leſs in a mediate ſufficiency, but much leſs in an immediate ſufficiency of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Chriſt, and ſo by conſequence the whole and adequate ſubject of this his Treatiſe rendred diſſonant both to Scripture and Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And before I cloſe up this my work, and make my due and legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate claim, I cannot but let him and his Church know, that I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice (as all the world may) of their Improvident boldneſs in that Book entituled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>(The Agreement and diſtance of Brethren)</hi> wherein they undertake to excude and thruſt into the world their indigeſted thoughts upon the five controverted Articles. In the third Article, they pretend they cannot agree with their brethren in the confinement of the grace of God in the intendments of ſalvation to the ſmall number of Gods elect, becauſe they judge the Scripture clear in this, that God gives to all men ſufficient means whereby to be ſaved; thus they ſay, <hi>Pag.</hi> 34. of that Treatiſe; it will be ſomthing digreſſive and irrelative to my preſent task to engage with them in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:118748:71"/>
that confinement of divine grace, and ſo to ſtate it truly how we would have that grace to extend; the task I have in hand is only to anſwer Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> who would extend that grace as far as nature, or elſe make the grace of God to be no grace, and ſo I am fairly led to look upon their firſt Argument that moveth them to diſſent, which they expreſs to be this, That God gives all a ſufficiency of means whereby to be ſaved; a poſition which few before them have aſſerted and proved, yea, the beſt of their ſide have and do expreſly deny it; but Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> and his Church think they have Scriptures clear for it. And what Scriptures, I pray? we read them from their pens, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of his truth,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9. <hi>Not willing any ſhould periſh, but ſhould come to repentance.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Are theſe Scriptures produced to prove an actuall beſtowing of ſufficient means for ſalvation? and why not of actuall ſalvation too for they run in equipage, and he willeth that all men be ſaved as well as that they ſhould come to the knowledge of the truth. So that by theſe texts they may as well prove that God actually ſaves all men.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Have neither the Paſtour nor people of that Church, this in conſideration, that theſe texts are expounded by the beſt of their own ſide, of the antecedent will of God, which in reſpect of mens malice and wickedneſs doth not always come to paſs? and they will grant that God by his Antecedent will intendeth to give ſufficient means; but becauſe they uſe not nature well, or God fore-ſeeth them incorrigible, or their fore-fathers have refuſed the Goſpel, therefore God doth not reveal Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Theſe texts favour not Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> one whit; if they think that God gives ſufficient means to be ſaved, to thoſe that never had the letter of the Goſpel; for theſe texts preſuppoſeth the letter of the Goſpel, ſo runneth the text, <hi>(And come to the knowledge of the truth;)</hi> No ſufficiency to be ſaved until they have the knowledge of the truth; and as not by theſe Scriptures, ſo neither by any other or any colour of reaſon do they prove that daring aſſertion <hi>(viz.) That God gives to all men ſufficient means whereby to be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus to conclude with his own expreſſion, I have in the midſt of many preſſing occaſions in my Paſtoral Charge, impartially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured to ventilate the truth; whether any thing I have ſaid will turn to ſo happy an account as ſatisfaction, I cannot propheſie. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, until (in caſe he receive not) he give ſatisfaction to the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I muſt put in a Caveat againſt his Claim, which he makes, <hi>Pag.</hi> 61. and I ſhall make a legitimate Claim ſo far, as that he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render up the cauſe, until he prove that all men are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt; for till that be proved, or at leaſt that Chriſt hath made ſome proportionable diſcoveries of that purchaſe made, that ſo men may be enabled to believe, and ſo have that purchaſe applyed; I ſhall conclude that Chriſt did not lay down the price of his own blood to purchaſe life and ſalvation for all men without exception.</p>
